Special instances of sparse graphs appear in rigidity theory and have\nreceived increased attention in recent years. In particular, our colored\npebbles generalize and strengthen the previous results of Lee and Streinu and\ngive a new proof of the Tutte-Nash-Williams characterization of arboricity. We\nalso present a new decomposition that certifies sparsity based on the\n$(k,\\ell)$-pebble game with colors. Our work also exposes connections between\npebble game algorithms and previous sparse graph algorithms by Gabow, Gabow and\nWestermann and Hendrickson.\n",

We introduce and investigate globally (or\nintrinsically, free from local coordinates) many of the most important and most\ncommonly used special Finsler manifolds: locally Minkowskian, Berwald,\nLandesberg, general Landesberg, $P$-reducible, $C$-reducible,\nsemi-$C$-reducible, quasi-$C$-reducible, $P^{*}$-Finsler, $C^{h}$-recurrent,\n$C^{v}$-recurrent, $C^{0}$-recurrent, $S^{v}$-recurrent, $S^{v}$-recurrent of\nthe second order, $C_{2}$-like, $S_{3}$-like, $S_{4}$-like, $P_{2}$-like,\n$R_{3}$-like, $P$-symmetric, $h$-isotropic, of scalar curvature, of constant\ncurvature, of $p$-scalar curvature, of $s$-$ps$-curvature. The global\ndefinitions of these special Finsler manifolds are introduced. Various\nrelationships between the different types of the considered special Finsler\nmanifolds are found. Many local results, known in the literature, are proved\nglobally and several new results are obtained. As a by-product, interesting\nidentities and properties concerning the torsion tensor fields and the\ncurvature tensor fields are deduced. Although our investigation is entirely\nglobal, we provide; for comparison reasons, an appendix presenting a local\ncounterpart of our global approach and the local definitions of the special\nFinsler spaces considered.\n",

At time zero, the gas consists of $n$ identical particles\nthat are randomly distributed on the real line and have zero initial speeds.\nParticles begin to move under the forces of mutual attraction. When particles\ncollide, they stick together forming a new particle, called cluster, whose mass\nand speed are defined by the laws of conservation. We are interested in the\nasymptotic behavior of $K_n(t)$ as $n\\to \\infty$, where $K_n(t)$ denotes the\nnumber of clusters at time $t$ in the system with $n$ initial particles. Our\nmain result is a functional limit theorem for $K_n(t)$. Its proof is based on\nthe discovered localization property of the aggregation process, which states\nthat the behavior of each particle is essentially defined by the motion of\nneighbor particles.\n",

This is done via a study of the\ngeometry of G and a generalization of P. Pansu's thesis. In particular, we show\nthat any such G is weakly commensurable to some simply connected solvable Lie\ngroup S, the Lie shadow of G. We also show that large balls in G have an\nasymptotic shape, i.e. after a suitable renormalization, they converge to a\nlimiting compact set which can be interpreted geometrically. We then discuss\nthe speed of convergence, treat some examples and give an application to\nergodic theory. We also answer a question of Burago about left invariant\nmetrics and recover some results of Stoll on the irrationality of growth series\nof nilpotent groups.\n",

The study and\nclassification of pairs $(M,\\F)$ is a challenging (and difficult) problem. In\nthis setting, a classical result due to Reeb \\cite{Reeb} states that a manifold\nadmitting a foliation with exactly two center-type singularities is a sphere.\nIn particular this is true if the foliation is given by a function. Along these\nlines a result due to Eells and Kuiper \\cite{Ku-Ee} classify manifolds having a\nreal-valued function admitting exactly three non-degenerate singular points. In\nthe present paper, we prove a generalization of the above mentioned results. To\ndo this, we first describe the possible arrangements of pairs of singularities\nand the corresponding codimension one invariant sets, and then we give an\nelimination procedure for suitable center-saddle and some saddle-saddle\nconfigurations (of consecutive indices). In the second part, we investigate if\nother classical results, such as Haefliger and Novikov (Compact Leaf) theorems,\nproved for regular foliations, still hold true in presence of singularities. At\nthis purpose, in the singular set, $Sing(\\F)$ of the foliation $\\F$, we\nconsider {\\em{weakly stable}} components, that we define as those components\nadmitting a neighborhood where all leaves are compact. If $Sing(\\F)$ admits\nonly weakly stable components, given by smoothly embedded curves diffeomorphic\nto $S^1$, we are able to extend Haefliger's theorem. Finally, the existence of\na closed curve, transverse to the foliation, leads us to state a Novikov-type\nresult.\n",

For the exceptional types, these\ndecomposition numbers have been computed by the first author. The type $A_n$\ndecomposition numbers have been computed by Goulden and Jackson, albeit using a\nsomewhat different language. We explain how to extract the type $B_n$\ndecomposition numbers from results of B\\'ona, Bousquet, Labelle and Leroux on\nmap enumeration. Our formula for the type $D_n$ decomposition numbers is new.\nThese results are then used to determine, for a fixed positive integer $l$ and\nfixed integers $r_1\\le r_2\\le ...\\le r_l$, the number of multi-chains $\\pi_1\\le\n\\pi_2\\le ...\\le \\pi_l$ in Armstrong's generalised non-crossing partitions\nposet, where the poset rank of $\\pi_i$ equals $r_i$, and where the \"block\nstructure\" of $\\pi_1$ is prescribed. We demonstrate that this result implies\nall known enumerative results on ordinary and generalised non-crossing\npartitions via appropriate summations. Surprisingly, this result on multi-chain\nenumeration is new even for the original non-crossing partitions of Kreweras.\nMoreover, the result allows one to solve the problem of rank-selected chain\nenumeration in the type $D_n$ generalised non-crossing partitions poset, which,\nin turn, leads to a proof of Armstrong's $F=M$ Conjecture in type $D_n$.\n",

        "abstract": "  Given a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel, feedback from the\nreceiver can be used to specify a transmit precoding matrix, which selectively\nactivates the strongest channel modes. Here we analyze the performance of\nRandom Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selected\nfrom a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed\nentries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,\nwhich relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the\ntransmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of\nbeamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system\nrefers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go\nto infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,\ni.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The\nperformance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar\nquantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random\nsubspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and\napproximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers\n(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show\nthat these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size\nsystems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examples\nshow that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only\nslightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched\nfilter can require significantly more feedback.\n",

In this paper, based on weakly\ndependent sample, we investigate the single-index prediction (SIP) model which\nis robust against deviation from the single-index model. The single-index is\nidentified by the best approximation to the multivariate prediction function of\nthe response variable, regardless of whether the prediction function is a\ngenuine single-index function. A polynomial spline estimator is proposed for\nthe single-index prediction coefficients, and is shown to be root-n consistent\nand asymptotically normal. An iterative optimization routine is used which is\nsufficiently fast for the user to analyze large data of high dimension within\nseconds. Simulation experiments have provided strong evidence that corroborates\nwith the asymptotic theory. Application of the proposed procedure to the rive\nflow data of Iceland has yielded superior out-of-sample rolling forecasts.\n",

However, if matter and energy, as well as life and cognition,\nare described in terms of information, evolution can be described consistently\nas information becoming more complex.\n  The paper presents eight tentative laws of information, valid at multiple\nscales, which are generalizations of Darwinian, cybernetic, thermodynamic,\npsychological, philosophical, and complexity principles.

The class of\nelliptic quadratic differential operators stands for the class of operators\ndefined in the Weyl quantization by complex-valued elliptic quadratic symbols.\nWe establish in this paper a simple necessary and sufficient condition on the\nWeyl symbol of these operators, which ensures the stability of their spectra.\nWhen this condition is violated, we prove that it occurs some strong spectral\ninstabilities for the high energies of these operators, in some regions which\ncan be far away from their spectra. We give a precise geometrical description\nof them, which explains the results obtained for these operators in some\nnumerical simulations giving the computation of false eigenvalues far from\ntheir spectra by algorithms for eigenvalues computing.\n",

        "abstract": "  Product probability property, known in the literature as statistical\nindependence, is examined first. Then generalized entropies are introduced, all\nof which give generalizations to Shannon entropy. It is shown that the nature\nof the recursivity postulate automatically determines the logarithmic\nfunctional form for Shannon entropy. Due to the logarithmic nature, Shannon\nentropy naturally gives rise to additivity, when applied to situations having\nproduct probability property. It is argued that the natural process is\nnon-additivity, important, for example, in statistical mechanics, even in\nproduct probability property situations and additivity can hold due to the\ninvolvement of a recursivity postulate leading to a logarithmic function.\nGeneralizations, including Mathai's generalized entropy are introduced and some\nof the properties are examined. Situations are examined where Mathai's entropy\nleads to pathway models, exponential and power law behavior and related\ndifferential equations. Connection of Mathai's entropy to Kerridge's measure of\n\"inaccuracy\" is also explored.\n",

Nevertheless, good puncturing patterns can\nonly be identified by means of an exhaustive search, whilst convergence towards\nlow bit error probabilities can be problematic when the systematic output of a\nrate-1/2 partially systematic PCCC is heavily punctured. In this paper, we\npresent and study a family of rate-1/2 partially systematic PCCCs, which we\ncall pseudo-randomly punctured codes. We evaluate their bit error rate\nperformance and we show that they always yield a lower error floor than that of\ntheir rate-1/3 parent codes. Furthermore, we compare analytic results to\nsimulations and we demonstrate that their performance converges towards the\nerror floor region, owning to the moderate puncturing of their systematic\noutput. Consequently, we propose pseudo-random puncturing as a means of\nimproving the bandwidth efficiency of a PCCC and simultaneously lowering its\nerror floor.\n",

Our approach will include identification of an\nexplicit two-phase mechanism by which particles can build up in sufficient\nnumbers with spatial positions near $-\\gamma t$ and type positions near $\\kappa\n\\sqrt{t}$ at large times $t$. The proofs involve the application of a variety\nof martingale techniques--most importantly a ``spine'' construction involving a\nchange of measure with an additive martingale. In addition to the model's\nintrinsic interest, the methodologies presented contain ideas that will adapt\nto other branching settings.

        "abstract": "  Semimartingale reflecting Brownian motions (SRBMs) living in the closures of\ndomains with piecewise smooth boundaries are of interest in applied probability\nbecause of their role as heavy traffic approximations for some stochastic\nnetworks. In this paper, assuming certain conditions on the domains and\ndirections of reflection, a perturbation result, or invariance principle, for\nSRBMs is proved. This provides sufficient conditions for a process that\nsatisfies the definition of an SRBM, except for small random perturbations in\nthe defining conditions, to be close in distribution to an SRBM. A crucial\ningredient in the proof of this result is an oscillation inequality for\nsolutions of a perturbed Skorokhod problem. We use the invariance principle to\nshow weak existence of SRBMs under mild conditions. We also use the invariance\nprinciple, in conjunction with known uniqueness results for SRBMs, to give some\nsufficient conditions for validating approximations involving (i) SRBMs in\nconvex polyhedrons with a constant reflection vector field on each face of the\npolyhedron, and (ii) SRBMs in bounded domains with piecewise smooth boundaries\nand possibly nonconstant reflection vector fields on the boundary surfaces.\n",

We study different coding strategies in\nthe single-source single-destination network with many relay nodes. Given the\nmyriad of ways in which nodes can cooperate, there is a natural routing\nproblem, i.e., determining an ordered set of nodes to relay the data from the\nsource to the destination. We find that for a given route, the\ndecode-and-forward strategy, which is an information theoretic cooperative\ncoding strategy, achieves rates significantly higher than that achievable by\nthe usual multi-hop coding strategy, which is a point-to-point non-cooperative\ncoding strategy. We construct an algorithm to find an optimal route (in terms\nof rate maximizing) for the decode-and-forward strategy. Since the algorithm\nruns in factorial time in the worst case, we propose a heuristic algorithm that\nruns in polynomial time. The heuristic algorithm outputs an optimal route when\nthe nodes transmit independent codewords. We implement these coding strategies\nusing practical low density parity check codes to compare the performance of\nthe strategies on different routes.\n",

A semi parametric model is proposed to decompose a\nseries of household quantities into individual quantities which are then used\nas inputs of the KDEM.

        "abstract": "  This paper investigates the many-to-one throughput capacity (and by symmetry,\none-to-many throughput capacity) of IEEE 802.11 multi-hop networks. It has\ngenerally been assumed in prior studies that the many-to-one throughput\ncapacity is upper-bounded by the link capacity L. Throughput capacity L is not\nachievable under 802.11. This paper introduces the notion of \"canonical\nnetworks\", which is a class of regularly-structured networks whose capacities\ncan be analyzed more easily than unstructured networks. We show that the\nthroughput capacity of canonical networks under 802.11 has an analytical upper\nbound of 3L/4 when the source nodes are two or more hops away from the sink;\nand simulated throughputs of 0.690L (0.740L) when the source nodes are many\nhops away. We conjecture that 3L/4 is also the upper bound for general\nnetworks. When all links have equal length, 2L/3 can be shown to be the upper\nbound for general networks. Our simulations show that 802.11 networks with\nrandom topologies operated with AODV routing can only achieve throughputs far\nbelow the upper bounds. Fortunately, by properly selecting routes near the\ngateway (or by properly positioning the relay nodes leading to the gateway) to\nfashion after the structure of canonical networks, the throughput can be\nimproved significantly by more than 150%. Indeed, in a dense network, it is\nworthwhile to deactivate some of the relay nodes near the sink judiciously.\n",

With resorting to this coding scheme,\nachievable rate regions of the IC-DMS in both discrete memoryless and Gaussian\ncases are derived, which, in general, include several previously known rate\nregions. Numerical examples for the Gaussian case demonstrate that in the\nhigh-interference-gain regime, the derived achievable rate regions offer\nconsiderable improvements over these existing results.\n",

We show that $A$ is complete if\n$|A|> 1+2\\sqrt{n-4}$, thus proving the last conjecture.\n",

Each\ncase can be characterized by simple conditions on the present short rate. We\ngive conditions under which the short rate process will converge to a limit\ndistribution and describe the limit distribution in terms of its cumulant\ngenerating function. We apply our results to the Vasicek model, the CIR model,\na CIR model with added jumps and a model of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type.\n",

There is a\ndetailed mathematical understanding of the depinning transition in 2 dimensions\nwithout disorder. Then the variance of the interface height w.r.t. the Gibbs\nmeasure stays bounded uniformly in the volume for any positive pinning force\nand diverges like the logarithm of the pinning force when it tends to zero.\n  How does the presence of a quenched disorder term in the Hamiltonian modify\nthis transition? We show that an arbitarily weak random field term is enough to\nbeat an arbitrarily strong delta-pinning in 2 dimensions and will cause\ndelocalization. The proof is based on a rigorous lower bound for the overlap\nbetween local magnetizations and random fields in finite volume. In 2\ndimensions it implies growth faster than the volume which is a contradiction to\nlocalization. We also derive a simple complementary inequality which shows that\nin higher dimensions the fraction of pinned sites converges to one when the\npinning force tends to infinity.\n",

Allowable\npredictors are drawn from some specified class, and the goal is to approach\nasymptotically the performance (expected loss) of the best predictor in the\nclass. We consider the setting in which one has perfect observation of the\n$X$-part of the sample, while the $Y$-part has to be communicated at some\nfinite bit rate. The encoding of the $Y$-values is allowed to depend on the\n$X$-values. Under suitable regularity conditions on the admissible predictors,\nthe underlying family of probability distributions and the loss function, we\ngive an information-theoretic characterization of achievable predictor\nperformance in terms of conditional distortion-rate functions. The ideas are\nillustrated on the example of nonparametric regression in Gaussian noise.\n",

We prove\nthat the asymptotic shape of this model is a Euclidean ball, in a sense which\nis stronger than our earlier work. For the shape consisting of $n=\\omega_d r^d$\nsites, where $\\omega_d$ is the volume of the unit ball in $\\R^d$, we show that\nthe inradius of the set of occupied sites is at least $r-O(\\log r)$, while the\noutradius is at most $r+O(r^\\alpha)$ for any $\\alpha > 1-1/d$. For a related\nmodel, the divisible sandpile, we show that the domain of occupied sites is a\nEuclidean ball with error in the radius a constant independent of the total\nmass. For the classical abelian sandpile model in two dimensions, with $n=\\pi\nr^2$ particles, we show that the inradius is at least $r/\\sqrt{3}$, and the\noutradius is at most $(r+o(r))/\\sqrt{2}$. This improves on bounds of Le Borgne\nand Rossin. Similar bounds apply in higher dimensions.\n",

        "abstract": "  The rotor-router model is a deterministic analogue of random walk. It can be\nused to define a deterministic growth model analogous to internal DLA. We prove\nthat the asymptotic shape of this model is a Euclidean ball, in a sense which\nis stronger than our earlier work. For the shape consisting of $n=\\omega_d r^d$\nsites, where $\\omega_d$ is the volume of the unit ball in $\\R^d$, we show that\nthe inradius of the set of occupied sites is at least $r-O(\\log r)$, while the\noutradius is at most $r+O(r^\\alpha)$ for any $\\alpha > 1-1/d$. For a related\nmodel, the divisible sandpile, we show that the domain of occupied sites is a\nEuclidean ball with error in the radius a constant independent of the total\nmass. For the classical abelian sandpile model in two dimensions, with $n=\\pi\nr^2$ particles, we show that the inradius is at least $r/\\sqrt{3}$, and the\noutradius is at most $(r+o(r))/\\sqrt{2}$. This improves on bounds of Le Borgne\nand Rossin. Similar bounds apply in higher dimensions.\n",

This inverse problem - known as electrical\nimpedance tomography - has many important practical applications and hence has\nfocussed much attention during the last years. However, to our best knowledge,\nno work has yet considered a second order approach for this problem. This paper\naims to fill that void: we investigate the existence of second order derivative\nof the state $u$ with respect to perturbations of the shape of the interface\n$\\partial\\omega$, then we choose a cost function in order to recover the\ngeometry of $\\partial \\omega$ and derive the expression of the derivatives\nneeded to implement the corresponding Newton method. We then investigate the\nstability of the process and explain why this inverse problem is severely\nill-posed by proving the compactness of the Hessian at the global minimizer.\n",

We use a ``natural'' refinement equation whose solution (a\nrefinable function) is the characteristic function of the unit disc. This\nequation reflects the fact that the characteristic function of the unit disc is\nthe sum of $p$ characteristic functions of disjoint discs of radius $p^{-1}$.\nThe case $p=2$ is studied in detail. Our MRA is a 2-adic analog of the real\nHaar MRA. But in contrast to the real setting, the refinable function\ngenerating our Haar MRA is periodic with period 1, which never holds for real\nrefinable functions. This fact implies that there exist infinity many different\n2-adic orthonormal wavelet bases in ${\\cL}^2(\\bQ_2)$ generated by the same Haar\nMRA. All of these bases are constructed. Since $p$-adic pseudo-differential\noperators are closely related to wavelet-type bases, our bases can be\nintensively used for applications.\n",

The results are applied to LIBOR market models in order to deal\nwith the typical stochastic drift and with stochastic volatility. In contrast\nto other accurate methods like numerical schemes for the full SDE, we obtain\neasily tractable expressions for accurate pricing. In particular, we present an\neasily tractable alternative to ``freezing the drift'' in LIBOR market models,\nwhich has an accuracy similar to the full numerical scheme. Numerical examples\nunderline the results.\n",

In this paper we prove that energy is conserved for\nvelocities in the function space $B^{1/3}_{3,c(\\NN)}$. We show that this space\nis sharp in a natural sense. We phrase the energy spectrum in terms of the\nLittlewood-Paley decomposition and show that the energy flux is controlled by\nlocal interactions. This locality is shown to hold also for the helicity flux;\nmoreover, every weak solution of the Euler equations that belongs to\n$B^{2/3}_{3,c(\\NN)}$ conserves helicity. In contrast, in two dimensions, the\nstrong locality of the enstrophy holds only in the ultraviolet range.\n",

In this note, we\ncomplete/correct two oversights in that paper.\n  The first is to note that in that paper a general nonimmersion result was\nstated which yielded new nonimmersions for RP^n with n as small as 48, and yet\nit was stated there that the first new result occurred when n=1536. Here we\ngive a simple proof of those overlooked results.\n  Secondly, we fill in a gap in the proof of the 2002 paper. There it was\nclaimed that an axial map f must satisfy f^*(X)=X_1+X_2. We realized recently\nthat this is not clear. However, here we show that it is true up multiplication\nby a unit in the appropriate ring, and so we retrieve all the nonimmersion\nresults claimed in the original paper.\n  Finally, we present a complete determination of tmf^{8*}(RP^\\infty\\times\nRP^\\infty) and tmf^*(CP^\\infty\\times CP^\\infty) in positive dimensions.\n",

A primary advantage of\nthe proposed technique is that relay selection can be performed in a\ndistributed way.

        "abstract": "  It has been shown that a decentralized relay selection protocol based on\nopportunistic feedback from the relays yields good throughput performance in\ndense wireless networks. This selection strategy supports a hybrid-ARQ\ntransmission approach where relays forward parity information to the\ndestination in the event of a decoding error. Such an approach, however,\nsuffers a loss compared to centralized strategies that select relays with the\nbest channel gain to the destination. This paper closes the performance gap by\nadding another level of channel feedback to the decentralized relay selection\nproblem. It is demonstrated that only one additional bit of feedback is\nnecessary for good throughput performance. The performance impact of varying\nkey parameters such as the number of relays and the channel feedback threshold\nis discussed. An accompanying bit error rate analysis demonstrates the\nimportance of relay selection.\n",

This sufficient condition\nis that this new maximal function be bounded on some $ L ^{p}$, for some $\n1<p<2$.

It is shown to have nonnegative structure constants, and several\ninteresting properties relative to the space of quasisymmetric functions\nassociated to matroids by the Hopf algebra morphism (F) of Billera, Jia, and\nReiner. In particular, for loopless matroids, this basis reflects the grading\nby matroid rank, as well as by the size of the ground set. It is shown that the\nmorphism F is injective on the set of rank two matroids, and that\ndecomposability of the quasisymmetric function of a rank two matroid mirrors\nthe decomposability of its base polytope. An affirmative answer is given to the\nHilbert basis question raised by Billera, Jia, and Reiner.\n",

We show that for a monotonic distribution over an alphabet of\nsize $k$, each probability parameter costs essentially $0.5 \\log (n/k^3)$ bits,\nwhere $n$ is the coded sequence length, as long as $k = o(n^{1/3})$. Otherwise,\nfor $k = O(n)$, the total average sequence redundancy is $O(n^{1/3+\\epsilon})$\nbits overall. We then show that there exists a sub-class of monotonic\ndistributions over infinite alphabets for which redundancy of\n$O(n^{1/3+\\epsilon})$ bits overall is still achievable. This class contains\nfast decaying distributions, including many distributions over the integers and\ngeometric distributions. For some slower decays, including other distributions\nover the integers, redundancy of $o(n)$ bits overall is achievable, where a\nmethod to compute specific redundancy rates for such distributions is derived.\nThe results are specifically true for finite entropy monotonic distributions.\nFinally, we study individual sequence redundancy behavior assuming a sequence\nis governed by a monotonic distribution. We show that for sequences whose\nempirical distributions are monotonic, individual redundancy bounds similar to\nthose in the average case can be obtained. However, even if the monotonicity in\nthe empirical distribution is violated, diminishing per symbol individual\nsequence redundancies with respect to the monotonic maximum likelihood\ndescription length may still be achievable.\n",

        "abstract": "  For a smooth projective curve, the cycles of e-secant k-planes are among the\nmost studied objects in classical enumerative geometry and there are well-known\nformulas due to Castelnuovo, Cayley and MacDonald concerning them. Despite\nvarious attempts, surprisingly little is known about the enumerative validity\nof such formulas. The aim of this paper is to completely clarify this problem\nin the case of the generic curve C of given genus. Using degeneration\ntechniques and a few facts about the birational geometry of moduli spaces of\nstable pointed curves we determine precisely under which conditions the cycle\nof e-secant k-planes in non-empty and we compute its dimension. We also\nprecisely determine the dimension of the variety of linear series on C carrying\ne-secant k-planes. In a different direction, in the last part of the paper we\nstudy the distribution of ramification points of the powers of a line bundle on\nC having prescribed ramification at a given point.\n",

We\nprove that $Z^0 \\to 2\\gamma$ is forbidden for the twisted coproduct as well.\nThis result is also independent of the assumptions of quantum field theory. As\nan illustration of the use of our general formulae, we further show that $Z^0\n\\to \\nu + \\nu$ is forbidden for the standard or twisted coproduct of the\nPoincar\\'{e} group if the neutrino is massless, even if lepton number is not\nconserved.

        "abstract": "  The Katz-Sarnak density conjecture states that, in the limit as the\nconductors tend to infinity, the behavior of normalized zeros near the central\npoint of families of L-functions agree with the N -> oo scaling limits of\neigenvalues near 1 of subgroups of U(N). Evidence for this has been found for\nmany families by studying the n-level densities; for suitably restricted test\nfunctions the main terms agree with random matrix theory. In particular, all\none-parameter families of elliptic curves with rank r over Q(T) and the same\ndistribution of signs of functional equations have the same limiting behavior.\nWe break this universality and find family dependent lower order correction\nterms in many cases; these lower order terms have applications ranging from\nexcess rank to modeling the behavior of zeros near the central point, and\ndepend on the arithmetic of the family. We derive an alternate form of the\nexplicit formula for GL(2) L-functions which simplifies comparisons, replacing\nsums over powers of Satake parameters by sums of the moments of the Fourier\ncoefficients lambda_f(p). Our formula highlights the differences that we expect\nto exist from families whose Fourier coefficients obey different laws (for\nexample, we expect Sato-Tate to hold only for non-CM families of elliptic\ncurves). Further, by the work of Rosen and Silverman we expect lower order\nbiases to the Fourier coefficients in families of elliptic curves with rank\nover Q(T); these biases can be seen in our expansions. We analyze several\nfamilies of elliptic curves and see different lower order corrections,\ndepending on whether or not the family has complex multiplication, a forced\ntorsion point, or non-zero rank over Q(T).\n",

There are now many results showing\nagreement between the main terms of number theory and random matrix theory;\nhowever, there are very few families where the lower order terms are known.\nThese terms often depend on subtle arithmetic properties of the family, and\nprovide a way to break the universality of behavior. The L-functions Ratios\nConjecture provides a powerful and tractable way to predict these terms. We\ntest a specific case here, that of the 1-level density for the symplectic\nfamily of quadratic Dirichlet characters arising from even fundamental\ndiscriminants d \\le X. For test functions supported in (-1/3, 1/3) we calculate\nall the lower order terms up to size O(X^{-1/2+epsilon}) and observe perfect\nagreement with the conjecture (for test functions supported in (-1, 1) we show\nagreement up to errors of size O(X^{-epsilon}) for any epsilon). Thus for this\nfamily and suitably restricted test functions, we completely verify the Ratios\nConjecture's prediction for the 1-level density.\n",

        "abstract": "  In a sensor network, in practice, the communication among sensors is subject\nto:(1) errors or failures at random times; (3) costs; and(2) constraints since\nsensors and networks operate under scarce resources, such as power, data rate,\nor communication. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor in\ndetermining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link.\nThese probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate.\nThe paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the\nprobabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to\nmaximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link\ncommunication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall\ncommunication budget constraint. To consider this problem, we address a number\nof preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2)\nestablish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and\nalmost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail;\nand, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for both\nmss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph\ndescribing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we\nformulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to a\ncommunication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem to\nwhich we apply semidefinite programming techniques. We show by an extensive\nnumerical study that the optimal design improves significantly the convergence\nspeed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the asymptotic performance of\na non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost.\n",

        "abstract": "  MIMO technology is one of the most significant advances in the past decade to\nincrease channel capacity and has a great potential to improve network capacity\nfor mesh networks. In a MIMO-based mesh network, the links outgoing from each\nnode sharing the common communication spectrum can be modeled as a Gaussian\nvector broadcast channel. Recently, researchers showed that ``dirty paper\ncoding'' (DPC) is the optimal transmission strategy for Gaussian vector\nbroadcast channels. So far, there has been little study on how this fundamental\nresult will impact the cross-layer design for MIMO-based mesh networks. To fill\nthis gap, we consider the problem of jointly optimizing DPC power allocation in\nthe link layer at each node and multihop/multipath routing in a MIMO-based mesh\nnetworks. It turns out that this optimization problem is a very challenging\nnon-convex problem. To address this difficulty, we transform the original\nproblem to an equivalent problem by exploiting the channel duality. For the\ntransformed problem, we develop an efficient solution procedure that integrates\nLagrangian dual decomposition method, conjugate gradient projection method\nbased on matrix differential calculus, cutting-plane method, and subgradient\nmethod. In our numerical example, it is shown that we can achieve a network\nperformance gain of 34.4% by using DPC.\n",

Such a representation, although useful, is not especially\nrevealing of the structure of a particular medium. We propose an axiomatic\ndefinition of the concept of a `mediatic graph'. We prove that the graph of any\nmedium is a mediatic graph. We also show that, for any non-necessarily finite\nset S, there exists a bijection from the collection M of all the media on a\ngiven set S (of states) onto the collection G of all the mediatic graphs on S.\n",

In this article, we study the stability of isotropic spherical\nsymmetric galaxy models $f_{0}(E)$, for which the distribution function $f_{0}$\ndepends on the particle energy $E$ only. In the first part of the article, we\nderive the first sufficient criterion for linear instability of $f_{0}(E):$\n$f_{0}(E)$ is linearly unstable if the second-order operator \\[\nA_{0}\\equiv-\\Delta+4\\pi\\int f_{0}^{\\prime}(E)\\{I-\\mathcal{P}\\}dv \\] has a\nnegative direction, where $\\mathcal{P}$ is the projection onto the function\nspace $\\{g(E,L)\\},$ $L$ being the angular momentum [see the explicit formula\n(\\ref{A0-radial})]. In the second part of the article, we prove that for the\nimportant King model, the corresponding $A_{0}$ is positive definite. Such a\npositivity leads to the nonlinear stability of the King model under all\nspherically symmetric perturbations.\n",

We show that the set of toric symplectic ball packings of\nM admits the structure of a convex polytope. Previous work of the first author\nshows that up to equivalence, only CP^1 x CP^1 and CP^2 admit density one\npackings when n=2 and only CP^n admits density one packings when n>2. In\ncontrast, we show that for a fixed n>=2 and each r in (0, 1), there are\nuncountably many inequivalent 2n-dimensional symplectic-toric manifolds with a\nmaximal toric packing of density r. This result follows from a general analysis\nof how the densities of maximal packings change while varying a given\nsymplectic-toric manifold through a family of symplectic-toric manifolds that\nare equivariantly diffeomorphic but not equivariantly symplectomorphic.\n",

We show that the set of toric symplectic ball packings of\nM admits the structure of a convex polytope. Previous work of the first author\nshows that up to equivalence, only CP^1 x CP^1 and CP^2 admit density one\npackings when n=2 and only CP^n admits density one packings when n>2. In\ncontrast, we show that for a fixed n>=2 and each r in (0, 1), there are\nuncountably many inequivalent 2n-dimensional symplectic-toric manifolds with a\nmaximal toric packing of density r. This result follows from a general analysis\nof how the densities of maximal packings change while varying a given\nsymplectic-toric manifold through a family of symplectic-toric manifolds that\nare equivariantly diffeomorphic but not equivariantly symplectomorphic.\n",

        "abstract": "  A drawback of Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity (K) as a function from s to the\nshortest program producing s is its noncomputability which limits its range of\napplicability. Moreover, when strings are short, the dependence of K on a\nparticular universal Turing machine U can be arbitrary. In practice one can\napproximate it by computable compression methods. However, such compression\nmethods do not always provide meaningful approximations--for strings shorter,\nfor example, than typical compiler lengths. In this paper we suggest an\nempirical approach to overcome this difficulty and to obtain a stable\ndefinition of the Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity for short sequences.\nAdditionally, a correlation in terms of distribution frequencies was found\nacross the output of two models of abstract machines, namely unidimensional\ncellular automata and deterministic Turing machine.\n",

The fading process in each branch is\nassumed to have an arbitrary Doppler spectrum with arbitrary Doppler bandwidth,\nbut to have distinct, asymmetric fading power spectral density characteristic.\nUsing 8-DPSK as an example, the average bit error probability (BEP) of the\noptimum diversity receiver is obtained by calculating the BEP for each of the\nthree individual bits. The BEP results derived are given in exact, explicit,\nclosed-form expressions which show clearly the behavior of the performance as a\nfunction of various system parameters.\n",

Contrary to the more classical frequential analysis based on the\nFourier transform, we can describe a singular asymptotic spectrum which has\ngood properties with respect to nonlinear operations. In this spirit we give\nseveral examples of propagation of singularities through nonlinear operators.\n",

We\nconsider the problem of description of polynomial hulls $\\wh{Gv}$ for orbits\n$Gv$, $v\\in V$, assuming that the identity component of $G$ is a torus $T$. The\npaper contains a universal construction for orbits which satisfy the inclusion\n$Gv\\subset T^\\bbC v$ and a characterization of pairs $(G,V)$ such that it is\ntrue for a generic $v\\in V$. The hull of a finite union of $T$-orbits in\n$T^\\bbC v$ can be distinguished in $\\clos T^\\bbC v$ by a finite collection of\ninequalities of the type $\\abs{z_1}^{s_1}...\\abs{z_n}^{s_n}\\leq c$. In\nparticular, this is true for $Gv$. If powers in the monomials are independent\nof $v$, $Gv\\subset T^\\bbC v$ for a generic $v$, and either the center of $G$ is\nfinite or $T^\\bbC$ has an open orbit, then the space $V$ and the group $G$ are\nproducts of standard ones; the latter means that $G=S_nT$, where $S_n$ is the\ngroup of all permutations of coordinates and $T$ is either $\\bbT^n$ or\n$\\SU(n)\\cap\\bbT^n$, where $\\bbT^n$ is the torus of all diagonal matrices in\n$\\rU(n)$.

This result is already known,\nbut we formulate it in a different form and supply with a shorter proof.\n",

In the\nsecond stage we select one model by cross-validation. In the third stage we use\nhypothesis testing to eliminate some variables.

In a vector downlink channel\n(single antenna at each receiver), the transmit antenna array can be used to\ntransmit separate data streams to multiple receivers only if the transmitter\nhas very accurate channel knowledge, i.e., if there is high-rate channel\nfeedback from each receiver. In this work it is shown that channel feedback\nrequirements can be significantly reduced if each receiver has a small number\nof antennas and appropriately combines its antenna outputs. A combining method\nthat minimizes channel quantization error at each receiver, and thereby\nminimizes multi-user interference, is proposed and analyzed. This technique is\nshown to outperform traditional techniques such as maximum-ratio combining\nbecause minimization of interference power is more critical than maximization\nof signal power in the multiple antenna downlink. Analysis is provided to\nquantify the feedback savings, and the technique is seen to work well with user\nselection and is also robust to receiver estimation error.\n",

The non-linearities\nappear both as additive drift terms and as multipliers of the noise. Using\ntechniques of Malliavin calculus, we establish upper and lower bounds on the\none-point density of the solution u(t,x), and upper bounds of Gaussian-type on\nthe two-point density of (u(s,y),u(t,x)). In particular, this estimate\nquantifies how this density degenerates as (s,y) converges to (t,x). From these\nresults, we deduce upper and lower bounds on hitting probabilities of the\nprocess {u(t,x)}_{t \\in \\mathbb{R}_+, x \\in [0,1]}, in terms of respectively\nHausdorff measure and Newtonian capacity. These estimates make it possible to\nshow that points are polar when d >6 and are not polar when d<6. We also show\nthat the Hausdorff dimension of the range of the process is 6 when d>6, and\ngive analogous results for the processes t \\mapsto u(t,x) and x \\mapsto u(t,x).\nFinally, we obtain the values of the Hausdorff dimensions of the level sets of\nthese processes.\n",

        "abstract": "  This paper deals with a family of spatial rational curves that were\nintroduced by Andradas, Recio and Sendra, under the name of hypercircles, as an\nalgorithmic cornerstone tool in the context of improving the rational\nparametrization (simplifying the coefficients of the rational functions, when\npossible) of algebraic varieties. A real circle can be defined as the image of\nthe real axis under a Moebius transformation in the complex field. Likewise,\nand roughly speaking, a hypercircle can be defined as the image of a line (\"the\n${\\mathbb{K}}$-axis\") in a $n$-degree finite algebraic extension\n$\\mathbb{K}(\\alpha)\\thickapprox\\mathbb{K}^n$ under the transformation\n$\\frac{at+b}{ct+d}:\\mathbb{K}(\\alpha)\\to\\mathbb{K}(\\alpha)$.\n  The aim of this article is to extend, to the case of hypercircles, some of\nthe specific properties of circles. We show that hypercircles are precisely,\nvia $\\mathbb{K}$-projective transformations, the rational normal curve of a\nsuitable degree. We also obtain a complete description of the points at\ninfinity of these curves (generalizing the cyclic structure at infinity of\ncircles). We characterize hypercircles as those curves of degree equal to the\ndimension of the ambient affine space and with infinitely many\n${\\mathbb{K}}$-rational points, passing through these points at infinity.\nMoreover, we give explicit formulae for the parametrization and implicitation\nof hypercircles. Besides the intrinsic interest of this very special family of\ncurves, the understanding of its properties has a direct application to the\nsimplification of parametrizations problem, as shown in the last section.\n",

In this setting, many letters are unseen and\nthe empirical distribution tends to overestimate the probability of the\nobserved letters. To overcome this problem, the traditional approach to\nprobability estimation is to use the classical Good-Turing estimator.

The oracle property is often a\nconsequence of sparsity of an estimator. We show that any estimator satisfying\na sparsity property has maximal risk that converges to the supremum of the loss\nfunction; in particular, the maximal risk diverges to infinity whenever the\nloss function is unbounded. For ease of presentation the result is set in the\nframework of a linear regression model, but generalizes far beyond that\nsetting. In a Monte Carlo study we also assess the extent of the problem in\nfinite samples for the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) estimator\nintroduced in Fan and Li (2001). We find that this estimator can perform rather\npoorly in finite samples and that its worst-case performance relative to\nmaximum likelihood deteriorates with increasing sample size when the estimator\nis tuned to sparsity.\n",

We describe the\nevolution of the Eve-population and the total population with continuous state\nbranching processes, and the neutral mutation procedure can be seen as an\nimmigration process with intensity proportional to the size of the population.\nFirst we establish a Williams' decomposition of the genealogy of the total\npopulation given by a continuous random tree, according to the ancestral\nlineage of the last individual alive. This allows us give a closed formula for\nthe probability of simultaneous extinction of the Eve-population and the total\npopulation.\n",

We derive the nonholonomic discrete Euler-Lagrange equations in a\nsetting which permits to deduce geometric integrators for continuous\nnonholonomic systems (reduced or not). The formalism is given in terms of Lie\ngroupoids, specifying a discrete Lagrangian and a constraint submanifold on it.\nAdditionally, it is necessary to fix a vector subbundle of the Lie algebroid\nassociated to the Lie groupoid. We also discuss the existence of nonholonomic\nevolution operators in terms of the discrete nonholonomic Legendre\ntransformations and in terms of adequate decompositions of the prolongation of\nthe Lie groupoid. The characterization of the reversibility of the evolution\noperator and the discrete nonholonomic momentum equation are also considered.\nFinally, we illustrate with several classical examples the wide range of\napplication of the theory (the discrete nonholonomic constrained particle, the\nSuslov system, the Chaplygin sleigh, the Veselova system, the rolling ball on a\nrotating table and the two wheeled planar mobile robot).\n",

        "abstract": "  We consider the problem of estimating the unconditional distribution of a\npost-model-selection estimator. The notion of a post-model-selection estimator\nhere refers to the combined procedure resulting from first selecting a model\n(e.g., by a model selection criterion like AIC or by a hypothesis testing\nprocedure) and then estimating the parameters in the selected model (e.g., by\nleast-squares or maximum likelihood), all based on the same data set. We show\nthat it is impossible to estimate the unconditional distribution with\nreasonable accuracy even asymptotically. In particular, we show that no\nestimator for this distribution can be uniformly consistent (not even locally).\nThis follows as a corollary to (local) minimax lower bounds on the performance\nof estimators for the distribution; performance is here measured by the\nprobability that the estimation error exceeds a given threshold. These lower\nbounds are shown to approach 1/2 or even 1 in large samples, depending on the\nsituation considered. Similar impossibility results are also obtained for the\ndistribution of linear functions (e.g., predictors) of the post-model-selection\nestimator.\n",

A systematic scan Markov\nchain cycles through finite-size subsets of vertices in a deterministic order\nand updates the colours assigned to the vertices of each subset. The systematic\nscan Markov chain that we present cycles through subsets consisting of 2x2\nsub-grids and updates the colours assigned to the vertices using a procedure\nknown as heat-bath. We give a computer-assisted proof that this systematic scan\nMarkov chain mixes in O(log n) scans, where n is the size of the rectangular\nsub-grid. We make use of a heuristic to compute required couplings of\ncolourings of 2x2 sub-grids. This is the first time the mixing time of a\nsystematic scan Markov chain on the grid has been shown to mix for less than 8\ncolours. We also give partial results that underline the challenges of proving\nrapid mixing of a systematic scan Markov chain for sampling 6-colourings of the\ngrid by considering 2x3 and 3x3 sub-grids.\n",

The ingredients in the formula come from\nthe Poincare metric in one higher dimension; hence the formula is called\nholographic. When specialized to the conformally flat case, the holographic\nformula expresses Q-curvature as a multiple of the Pfaffian and the divergence\nof a natural one-form. The paper also outlines the relation between holographic\nformulae for Q-curvature and a new theory of conformally covariant families of\ndifferential operators due to the second author.\n",

The major goal of LDC related\nresearch is to establish the optimal trade-off between length and query\ncomplexity of such codes.\n  Recently [Y] introduced a novel technique for constructing locally decodable\ncodes and vastly improved the upper bounds for code length. The technique is\nbased on Mersenne primes. In this paper we extend the work of [Y] and argue\nthat further progress via these methods is tied to progress on an old number\ntheory question regarding the size of the largest prime factors of Mersenne\nnumbers.\n  Specifically, we show that every Mersenne number m=2^t-1 that has a prime\nfactor p>m^\\gamma yields a family of k(\\gamma)-query locally decodable codes of\nlength Exp(n^{1/t}). Conversely, if for some fixed k and all \\epsilon > 0 one\ncan use the technique of [Y] to obtain a family of k-query LDCs of length\nExp(n^\\epsilon); then infinitely many Mersenne numbers have prime factors arger\nthan known currently.\n",

Dr\\'apal (\\cite{Dr9}) showed that a latin\nbitrade is equivalent to three derangements whose product is the identity and\nwhose cycles pairwise have at most one point in common. By letting a group act\non itself by right translation, we show how some latin bitrades may be derived\nfrom groups without specifying an independent group action. Properties of latin\ntrades such as homogeneousness, minimality (via thinness) and orthogonality may\nalso be encoded succinctly within the group structure. We apply the\nconstruction to some well-known groups, constructing previously unknown latin\nbitrades. In particular, we show the existence of minimal, $k$-homogeneous\nlatin trades for each odd $k\\geq 3$. In some cases these are the smallest known\nsuch examples.\n",

        "abstract": "  While most useful information theoretic inequalities can be deduced from the\nbasic properties of entropy or mutual information, up to now Shannon's entropy\npower inequality (EPI) is an exception: Existing information theoretic proofs\nof the EPI hinge on representations of differential entropy using either Fisher\ninformation or minimum mean-square error (MMSE), which are derived from de\nBruijn's identity. In this paper, we first present an unified view of these\nproofs, showing that they share two essential ingredients: 1) a data processing\nargument applied to a covariance-preserving linear transformation; 2) an\nintegration over a path of a continuous Gaussian perturbation. Using these\ningredients, we develop a new and brief proof of the EPI through a mutual\ninformation inequality, which replaces Stam and Blachman's Fisher information\ninequality (FII) and an inequality for MMSE by Guo, Shamai and Verd\\'u used in\nearlier proofs. The result has the advantage of being very simple in that it\nrelies only on the basic properties of mutual information. These ideas are then\ngeneralized to various extended versions of the EPI: Zamir and Feder's\ngeneralized EPI for linear transformations of the random variables, Takano and\nJohnson's EPI for dependent variables, Liu and Viswanath's\ncovariance-constrained EPI, and Costa's concavity inequality for the entropy\npower.\n",

        "abstract": "  We describe and analyze the joint source/channel coding properties of a class\nof sparse graphical codes based on compounding a low-density generator matrix\n(LDGM) code with a low-density parity check (LDPC) code. Our first pair of\ntheorems establish that there exist codes from this ensemble, with all degrees\nremaining bounded independently of block length, that are simultaneously\noptimal as both source and channel codes when encoding and decoding are\nperformed optimally. More precisely, in the context of lossy compression, we\nprove that finite degree constructions can achieve any pair $(R, D)$ on the\nrate-distortion curve of the binary symmetric source. In the context of channel\ncoding, we prove that finite degree codes can achieve any pair $(C, p)$ on the\ncapacity-noise curve of the binary symmetric channel. Next, we show that our\ncompound construction has a nested structure that can be exploited to achieve\nthe Wyner-Ziv bound for source coding with side information (SCSI), as well as\nthe Gelfand-Pinsker bound for channel coding with side information (CCSI).\nAlthough the current results are based on optimal encoding and decoding, the\nproposed graphical codes have sparse structure and high girth that renders them\nwell-suited to message-passing and other efficient decoding procedures.\n",

        "abstract": "  In this paper, we consider the Cauchy problem for Klein-Gordon equation with\na cubic convolution nonlinearity in $\\R^3$. By making use of Bourgain's method\nin conjunction with a precise Strichartz estimate of S.Klainerman and D.Tataru,\nwe establish the $H^s (s<1)$ global well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for\nthe cubic convolution defocusing Klein-Gordon-Hartree equation. Before arriving\nat the previously discussed conclusion, we obtain global solution for this\nnon-scaling equation with small initial data in $H^{s_0}\\times H^{s_0-1}$ where\n$s_0=\\frac\\gamma 6$ but not $\\frac\\gamma2-1$, for this equation that we\nconsider is a subconformal equation in some sense. In doing so a number of\nnonlinear prior estimates are already established by using Bony's\ndecomposition, flexibility of Klein-Gordon admissible pairs which are slightly\ndifferent from that of wave equation and a commutator estimate. We establish\nthis commutator estimate by exploiting cancellation property and utilizing\nCoifman and Meyer multilinear multiplier theorem. As far as we know, it seems\nthat this is the first result on low regularity for this Klein-Gordon-Hartree\nequation.\n",

We show that, under respective conditions, the proposed achievable\nregion reduces to Han and Kobayashi achievable region for interference\nchannels, the capacity region for degraded relay channels, and the capacity\nregion for the Gaussian vector broadcast channel. Numerical examples for the\nGaussian case are given.\n",

We prove the relative rigidity of the collection of\npairs $(X, \\JJ)$ as above. This generalises a result of Schwarz for symmetric\npatterns of geodesics in hyperbolic space. We show that a uniformly proper map\ninduces an isomorphism of the corresponding $C$-complexes. We also give a\ncouple of characterizations of quasiconvexity. of subgroups of hyperbolic\ngroups on the way.\n",

        "abstract": "  In spatially distributed multiuser antenna systems, the received signal\ncontains multiple carrier-frequency offsets (CFOs) arising from mismatch\nbetween the oscillators of transmitters and receivers. This results in a\ntime-varying rotation of the data constellation, which needs to be compensated\nat the receiver before symbol recovery. In this paper, a new approach for blind\nCFO estimation and symbol recovery is proposed. The received base-band signal\nis over-sampled, and its polyphase components are used to formulate a virtual\nMultiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) problem. By applying blind MIMO system\nestimation techniques, the system response can be estimated and decoupled\nversions of the user symbols can be recovered, each one of which contains a\ndistinct CFO. By applying a decision feedback Phase Lock Loop (PLL), the CFO\ncan be mitigated and the transmitted symbols can be recovered. The estimated\nMIMO system response provides information about the CFOs that can be used to\ninitialize the PLL, speed up its convergence, and avoid ambiguities usually\nlinked with PLL.\n",

In particular it is characterised by the polynomial solutions to the\nisomonodromic equations which are also orthogonal with respect to a deformation\nof the Laguerre weight. In the scaling to the hard edge regime we find an\nanalogous situation where a certain Painlev\\'e \\IIId system and its associated\nlinear isomonodromic system characterise the scaled distribution. We undertake\nextensive analytical studies of this system and use this knowledge to\naccurately compute the distribution and its moments for various values of the\nparameter $ a $. In particular choosing $ a=\\pm 1/2 $ allows the first\neigenvalue spacing distribution for random real orthogonal matrices to be\ncomputed.\n",

We also demonstrate how we use this to calculate\nthe driving function numerically. Equivalent results for other variants of the\nLoewner differential equation are also obtained: Multiple slits in the chordal\nLoewner differential equation and the radial Loewner differential equation. The\nmethod also works for other versions of the Loewner differential equation.

        "abstract": "  We replace the ice Ansatz on matrix solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation by\na weaker condition which we call \"rime\". Rime solutions include the standard\nDrinfeld-Jimbo R-matrix. Solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation within the rime\nAnsatz which are maximally different from the standard one we call \"strict\nrime\". A strict rime non-unitary solution is parameterized by a projective\nvector. We show that this solution transforms to the Cremmer-Gervais R-matrix\nby a change of basis with a matrix containing symmetric functions in the\ncomponents of the parameterizing vector. A strict unitary solution (the rime\nAnsatz is well adapted for taking a unitary limit) is shown to be equivalent to\na quantization of a classical \"boundary\" r-matrix of Gerstenhaber and\nGiaquinto. We analyze the structure of the elementary rime blocks and find, as\na by-product, that all non-standard R-matrices of GL(1|1)-type can be uniformly\ndescribed in a rime form.\n  We discuss then connections of the classical rime solutions with the Bezout\noperators. The Bezout operators satisfy the (non-)homogeneous associative\nclassical Yang--Baxter equation which is related to the Rota-Baxter operators.\n  We classify the rime Poisson brackets: they form a 3-dimensional pencil. A\nnormal form of each individual member of the pencil depends on the discriminant\nof a certain quadratic polynomial. We also classify orderable quadratic rime\nassociative algebras.\n  For the standard Drinfeld-Jimbo solution, there is a choice of the\nmultiparameters, for which it can be non-trivially rimed. However, not every\nBelavin-Drinfeld triple admits a choice of the multiparameters for which it can\nbe rimed. We give a minimal example.\n",

A property of\nKillpatrick's evacuation is given a simpler proof, but this evacuation is no\nlonger needed in making Roby's and Fomin's constructions coincide. We provide\nthe set of Young-Fibonacci tableaux of size $n$ with a structure of graded\nposet, induced by the weak order on permutations of the symmetric group, and\nrealized by transitive closure of elementary transformations on tableaux. We\nshow that this poset gives a combinatorial interpretation of the coefficients\nin the transition matrix from the analogue of complete symmetric functions to\nanalogue of the Schur functions in Okada's algebra. We end with a quite similar\nobservation for four posets on Young-tableaux studied by Taskin.\n",

Under the assumption that the\nlimiting mean eigenvalue density associated with $V$ is regular, and that the\norigin is a right endpoint of its support, we compute the limiting eigenvalue\ncorrelation kernel in the double scaling limit as $n, N \\to \\infty$ such that\n$n^{2/3}(n/N-1) = O(1)$. We use the Deift-Zhou steepest descent method for the\nRiemann-Hilbert problem for polynomials on the line orthogonal with respect to\nthe weight $|x|^{2\\alpha} e^{-NV(x)}$. Our main attention is on the\nconstruction of a local parametrix near the origin by means of the\n$\\psi$-functions associated with a distinguished solution of the Painleve XXXIV\nequation. This solution is related to a particular solution of the Painleve II\nequation, which however is different from the usual Hastings-McLeod solution.\n",

All geometric objects defined in this\ngeometry are not only functions of the positional argument $x$, but also depend\non the directional argument $y$. In other words, instead of dealing with\ngeometric objects defined on the manifold $M$, as in the case of classical\nAP-geometry, we are dealing with geometric objects in the pullback bundle\n$\\pi^{-1}(TM)$ (the pullback of the tangent bundle $TM$ by $ \\pi: T\nM\\longrightarrow M$). Many new geometric objects, which have no counterpart in\nthe classical AP-geometry, emerge in this more general context. We refer to\nsuch a geometry as generalized AP-geometry (GAP-geometry). In analogy to\nAP-geometry, we define a $d$-connection in $\\pi^{-1}(TM)$ having remarkable\nproperties, which we call the canonical $d$-connection, in terms of the unique\ntorsion-free Riemannian $d$-connection. In addition to these two\n$d$-connections, two more $d$-connections are defined, the dual and the\nsymmetric $d$-connections. Our space, therefore, admits twelve curvature\ntensors (corresponding to the four defined $d$-connections), three of which\nvanish identically. Simple formulae for the nine non-vanishing curvatures\ntensors are obtained, in terms of the torsion tensors of the canonical\n$d$-connection. The different $W$-tensors admitted by the space are also\ncalculated. All contractions of the $h$- and $v$-curvature tensors and the\n$W$-tensors are derived. Second rank symmetric and skew-symmetric tensors,\nwhich prove useful in physical applications, are singled out.\n",

Its properties are related to the highest Lyubeznik number\n$l = \\dim_k \\Ext_R^d(k,H^c_I(R)).$ In particular $R \\simeq B$ if and only if $l\n= 1.$ Moreover, we show that the natural homomorphism $\\Ext_R^d(k, H^c_I(R))\n\\to k$ is non-zero.\n",

Due to the large bandwidth of the system, the\nmultipath channel is assumed to be frequency-selective. By using noncooperative\ngame-theoretic models and large system analysis, explicit expressions are\nderived in terms of network parameters to measure the effects of self- and\nmultiple-access interference at a receiving access point. Performance of the\nPRake is compared in terms of achieved utilities and loss to that of the\nall-Rake receiver.\n",

The involution sigma is defined in terms of new plus-minus diagrams that\ngovern the D_n to D_{n-1} (resp. B_n to B_{n-1}, or C_n to C_{n-1}) branching.\nIt is also shown that the crystal B^{r,s} is perfect.

This is achieved by\nconstructing the crystal analogue sigma of the automorphism of the D_n(1)\n(resp. B_n(1) or A_{2n-1}(2)) Dynkin diagram that interchanges the 0 and 1\nnode. The involution sigma is defined in terms of new plus-minus diagrams that\ngovern the D_n to D_{n-1} (resp. B_n to B_{n-1}, or C_n to C_{n-1}) branching.\nIt is also shown that the crystal B^{r,s} is perfect. These crystals have been\nimplemented in MuPAD-Combinat; the implementation is discussed in terms of many\nexamples.\n",

The lifts of\ngeometric objects on tangent bundles are performed for certain classes of\nd-connections and frame transforms when the Riemann tensor is parametrized by\nconstant matrix coefficients. For such configurations, the flows of\nnon-stretching curves and corresponding bi-Hamilton and solitonic hierarchies\nencode information about Ricci flow evolution, Einstein spaces and exact\nsolutions in gravity and geometric mechanics. The applied methods were\nelaborated formally in Finsler geometry and allows us to develop the formalism\nfor generalized Riemann-Finsler and Lagrange spaces. Nevertheless, all\ngeometric constructions can be equivalently re-defined for the Levi Civita\nconnections and holonomic frames on (semi) Riemannian manifolds.\n",

We obtain\ngeneral formulas for the reduction of the main tensors and operators of\nRiemannian geometry. In particular, we provide what is probably the maximal\npossible generalization of Gauss, Codazzi and Ricci equations and various other\nstandard formulas in Kaluza-Klein and embedded spacetimes theories. After\ngeneral covariance breaking, part of the residual covariance is perceived by\neffective lower dimensional observers as an infinite dimensional gauge group.\nThis reduces to finite dimensions in Kaluza-Klein and other few remarkable\nbackgrounds, all characterized by the vanishing of appropriate lower\ndimensional tensors.\n",

The computation rules of D (or its appropriate subalgebra D')\nguarantee that in many applications S can be refinely analyzed or even\nexplicitly calculated. We outline some methods of homological algebra for the\nstudy of parametrization S. Especially the projectivity of a certain factor\nmodule (defined by the system equations) implies the parametrizability. We give\nsome examples to illustrate our computational methods.\n",

The results for Poincare duality\ncomplexes are recovered by restricting the results to the case of Poincare\nduality pairs with empty boundary. Up to oriented homotopy equivalence,\nthree-dimensional Poincare duality pairs are classified by their fundamental\ntriple consisting of the fundamental group system, the orientation character\nand the image of the fundamental class under the classifying map. Using the\nderived module category we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a\ngiven triple to be realised by a three-dimensional Poincare duality pair. The\nresults on classification and realisation yield splitting or decomposition\ntheorems for three-dimensional Poincare duality pairs, that is, conditions\nunder which a given three-dimensional Poincare duality pair decomposes as\ninterior or boundary connected sum of two three-dimensional Poincare duality\npairs.\n",

We extend this\nmodel to N=2 system, equipped with the totally anti-symmetric tensor associated\nwith the torsion on the target space geometry. Next we construct transition\nelements in the Lagrangian path integral formalism and apply them to the\nanalyses of the Witten indices in supersymmetric systems. We explicitly show\nthe formulation of the Dirac index on the torsional manifold which has already\nbeen studied. We also formulate the Euler characteristic and the Hirzebruch\nsignature on the torsional manifold.\n",

In particular a specialization to the\nfinite type case of the canonicla Wick rotation-rescaling theory, previously\ndeveloped by the authors, is provided. This includes, for arbitrary curvatures,\nparameterizations in terms of suitable measured geodesic laminations on open\nhyperbolic surfaces of finite type. The same geometric objects also\nparameterize complex projective structures on the surfaces. The coincidence of\nsuch parameter space is explained by means of geometric correlations between\nspacetimes of different curvatures and projective surfaces realized via\ncanonical WR-rescaling along the cosmological times. We also specialize on AdS\ncase mostly referring to recent results achieved by other authors. In\nparticular we describe maximal causal extensions of AdS globally hyperbolic\nspacetimes and an AdS approach to the theory of earthquakes for hyperbolic\nsurfaces of finite type. A general earthquake theorem is proved for the so\ncalled enhanced Teichmuller space. The case of spacetimes with conical timelike\nsingularities is also treated.\n",

The behaviour of the\nautomaton is mainly determined by the support of the random variable that\nselects one of the sixteen possible Boolean rules, independently for each cell.\nA cell is said to stabilize if it will not change its state anymore after some\ntime. We classify the random boolean automata according to the positivity of\ntheir probability of stabilization. Here is an example of a consequence of our\nresults: if the support contains at least 5 rules, then asymptotically as $N$\ntends to infinity the probability of stabilization is positive, whereas there\nexist random boolean cellular automata with 4 rules in their support for which\nthis probability tends to 0.\n",

Originally the main\nlenses were universal mapping properties and natural transformations. In recent\ndecades, the notion of adjoint functors has moved to center-stage as category\ntheory's primary tool to characterize what is important in mathematics. Our\nfocus here is to present a theory of adjoint functors. The basis for the theory\nis laid by first showing that the object-to-object \"heteromorphisms\" between\nthe objects of different categories (e.g., insertion of generators as a set to\ngroup map) can be rigorously treated within category theory. The heteromorphic\ntheory shows that all adjunctions arise from the birepresentations of the\nheteromorphisms between the objects of different categories.\n",

These models belong to the class of {\\sl kinetically\nconstrained lattice gases} (KCLG) which have been introduced and intensively\nstudied in physics literature as simple models for the liquid/glass transition.\nDue to the degeneracy of rates for KCLG there exists {\\sl blocked\nconfigurations} which do not evolve under the dynamics and in general the\nhyperplanes of configurations with a fixed number of particles can be\ndecomposed into different irreducible sets. As a consequence, both the Entropy\nand Relative Entropy method cannot be straightforwardly applied to prove the\nhydrodynamic limit. In particular, some care should be put when proving the One\nand Two block Lemmas which guarantee local convergence to equilibrium. We show\nthat, for initial profiles smooth enough and bounded away from zero and one,\nthe macroscopic density profile for our KCLG evolves under the diffusive time\nscaling according to the porous medium equation. Then we prove the same result\nfor more general profiles for a slightly perturbed dynamics obtained by adding\njumps of the Symmetric Simple Exclusion. The role of the latter is to remove\nthe degeneracy of rates and at the same time they are properly slowed down in\norder not to change the macroscopic behavior. The equilibrium fluctuations and\nthe magnitude of the spectral gap for this perturbed model are also obtained.\n",

        "abstract": "  In this work, the critical role of noisy feedback in enhancing the secrecy\ncapacity of the wiretap channel is established. Unlike previous works, where a\nnoiseless public discussion channel is used for feedback, the feed-forward and\nfeedback signals share the same noisy channel in the present model. Quite\ninterestingly, this noisy feedback model is shown to be more advantageous in\nthe current setting. More specifically, the discrete memoryless modulo-additive\nchannel with a full-duplex destination node is considered first, and it is\nshown that the judicious use of feedback increases the perfect secrecy capacity\nto the capacity of the source-destination channel in the absence of the\nwiretapper. In the achievability scheme, the feedback signal corresponds to a\nprivate key, known only to the destination. In the half-duplex scheme, a novel\nfeedback technique that always achieves a positive perfect secrecy rate (even\nwhen the source-wiretapper channel is less noisy than the source-destination\nchannel) is proposed. These results hinge on the modulo-additive property of\nthe channel, which is exploited by the destination to perform encryption over\nthe channel without revealing its key to the source. Finally, this scheme is\nextended to the continuous real valued modulo-$\\Lambda$ channel where it is\nshown that the perfect secrecy capacity with feedback is also equal to the\ncapacity in the absence of the wiretapper.\n",

This gives us seven related positive random\nvariables, for which we study, in particular, formulas for moments and Laplace\ntransforms; we also give (in many cases) series representations and asymptotics\nfor density functions and distribution functions. We further study Wright's\nconstants arising in the asymptotic enumeration of connected graphs; these are\nknown to be closely connected to the moments of the Brownian excursion area.\nThe main purpose is to compare the results for these seven Brownian areas by\nstating the results in parallel forms; thus emphasizing both the similarities\nand the differences. A recurring theme is the Airy function which appears in\nslightly different ways in formulas for all seven random variables. We further\nwant to give explicit relations between the many different similar notations\nand definitions that have been used by various authors. There are also some new\nresults, mainly to fill in gaps left in the literature. Some short proofs are\ngiven, but most proofs are omitted and the reader is instead referred to the\noriginal sources.\n",

Of interest is how the maximum throughput achieved by\nthe cognitive users scales with n. Furthermore, how far these users must be\nfrom a primary user to guarantee a given primary outage. Two scenarios are\nconsidered for the network scaling law: (i) when each cognitive transmitter\nuses constant power to communicate with a cognitive receiver at a bounded\ndistance away, and (ii) when each cognitive transmitter scales its power\naccording to the distance to a considered primary user, allowing the cognitive\ntransmitter-receiver distances to grow. Using single-hop transmission, suitable\nfor cognitive devices of opportunistic nature, we show that, in both scenarios,\nwith path loss larger than 2, the cognitive network throughput scales linearly\nwith the number of cognitive users. We then explore the radius of a primary\nexclusive region void of cognitive transmitters. We obtain bounds on this\nradius for a given primary outage constraint. These bounds can help in the\ndesign of a primary network with exclusive regions, outside of which cognitive\nusers may transmit freely. Our results show that opportunistic secondary\nspectrum access using single-hop transmission is promising.\n",

We are interested here in the\nexistence of weak solutions for the stationary problem in a bounded plane\ndomain or in two-dimensional exterior domain. Due to the third order of\nderivatives in the non-linear term, it's difficult to obtain solution\nsatisfying energy inequality. But with a good choice of boundary conditions, an\nadapt special basis and the use of the good properties of the trilinear form\nassociated to the non-linear term, we obtain energy solutions. The problem in\nbounded domain is treated and the more difficult problem on non bounded domain\ntoo.\n",

While conventional power\ncontrol algorithms require knowledge of a number of parameters of the signal of\ninterest and of the multiaccess interference, in this paper it is shown that in\na large CDMA system much of this information can be dispensed with, and\neffective distributed power control algorithms may be implemented with very\nlittle information on the user of interest. An uplink CDMA system subject to\nflat fading is considered with a focus on the cases in which a linear MMSE\nreceiver and a non-linear MMSE serial interference cancellation receiver are\nadopted; for the latter case new formulas are also given for the system SINR in\nthe large system asymptote. Experimental results show an excellent agreement\nbetween the performance and the power profile of the proposed distributed\nalgorithms and that of conventional ones that require much greater prior\nknowledge.\n",

Several non-cooperative games are proposed wherein users may vary\ntheir transmit power and their uplink receiver in order to maximize their\nutility, which is defined here as the ratio of data throughput to transmit\npower. In particular, the case in which a linear multiuser detector is adopted\nat the receiver is considered first, and then, the more challenging case in\nwhich non-linear decision feedback multiuser detectors are employed is\nconsidered. The proposed games are shown to admit a unique Nash equilibrium\npoint, while simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed\nsolutions, as well as that the use of a decision-feedback multiuser receiver\nbrings remarkable performance improvements.\n",

BPD automata are\na natural real-time restriction of pushdown automata. We show that BPD\ndimension is a robust notion by giving an equivalent characterization of BPD\ndimension in terms of BPD compressors. We then study the relationships between\nBPD compression, and the standard Lempel-Ziv (LZ) compression algorithm, and\nshow that in contrast to the finite-state compressor case, LZ is not universal\nfor bounded pushdown compressors in a strong sense: we construct a sequence\nthat LZ fails to compress signicantly, but that is compressed by at least a\nfactor 2 by a BPD compressor. As a corollary we obtain a strong separation\nbetween finite-state and BPD dimension.\n",

Existing work\nassume that the power of the additive noise is known and use the expected value\nof the fading gain in a linear function of the channel output to find\napproximate LLRs. In this work, we first assume that the power of the additive\nnoise is known and we find the optimum linear approximation of LLRs in the\nsense of maximum achievable transmission rate on the channel. The maximum\nachievable rate under this linear LLR calculation is almost equal to the\nmaximum achievable rate under true LLR calculation. We also observe that this\nmethod appears to be the optimum in the sense of bit error rate performance\ntoo. These results are then extended to the case that the noise power is\nunknown at the receiver and a performance almost identical to the case that the\nnoise power is perfectly known is obtained.\n",

        "abstract": "  A main distinguishing feature of a wireless network compared with a wired\nnetwork is its broadcast nature, in which the signal transmitted by a node may\nreach several other nodes, and a node may receive signals from several other\nnodes simultaneously. Rather than a blessing, this feature is treated more as\nan interference-inducing nuisance in most wireless networks today (e.g., IEEE\n802.11). This paper shows that the concept of network coding can be applied at\nthe physical layer to turn the broadcast property into a capacity-boosting\nadvantage in wireless ad hoc networks. Specifically, we propose a\nphysical-layer network coding (PNC) scheme to coordinate transmissions among\nnodes. In contrast to straightforward network coding which performs coding\narithmetic on digital bit streams after they have been received, PNC makes use\nof the additive nature of simultaneously arriving electromagnetic (EM) waves\nfor equivalent coding operation. And in doing so, PNC can potentially achieve\n100% and 50% throughput increases compared with traditional transmission and\nstraightforward network coding, respectively, in multi-hop networks. More\nspecifically, the information-theoretic capacity of PNC is almost double that\nof traditional transmission in the SNR region of practical interest (higher\nthan 0dB). We believe this is a first paper that ventures into EM-wave-based\nnetwork coding at the physical layer and demonstrates its potential for\nboosting network capacity.\n",

The goal is to construct a new estimator whose\nrisk is as close as possible to that of the best estimator in the family. We\npropose a general aggregation scheme that is universal in the following sense:\nit applies for families of arbitrary estimators and a wide variety of models\nand global risk measures. The procedure is based on comparison of empirical\nestimates of certain linear functionals with estimates induced by the family\n$\\mathcal{F}$. We derive oracle inequalities and show that they are\nunimprovable in some sense. Numerical results demonstrate good practical\nbehavior of the procedure.\n",

Using left regular matrix\nrepresentations of two specific classes of extended Clifford algebras, two\nsystematic algebraic constructions of full diversity Distributed Space-Time\nCodes (DSTCs) are provided for any power of two number of relays. The left\nregular matrix representation has been shown to naturally result in space-time\ncodes meeting the additional constraints required for DSTCs. The DSTCs so\nconstructed have the salient feature of reduced Maximum Likelihood (ML)\ndecoding complexity. In particular, the ML decoding of these codes can be\nperformed by applying the lattice decoder algorithm on a lattice of four times\nlesser dimension than what is required in general. Moreover these codes have a\nuniform distribution of power among the relays and in time, thus leading to a\nlow Peak to Average Power Ratio at the relays.\n",

To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first paper\nin which matrices over non-commutative rings is used to construct STBCs. An\nalgebraic explanation is provided for the 'ABBA' construction first proposed by\nTirkkonen et al and the tensor product construction proposed by Karmakar et al.\nFurthermore, it is established that the 4 transmit antenna STBC originally\nproposed by Tirkkonen et al based on the ABBA construction is actually a single\ncomplex symbol ML decodable code if the design variables are permuted and\nsignal sets of appropriate dimensions are chosen.\n",

For 3-noncrossing RNA\nstructures and RNA secondary structures we present a novel 4-term recursion\nformula and a 2-term recursion, respectively. Furthermore we enumerate for\narbitrary $k$ all $k$-noncrossing, restricted RNA structures i.e.\n$k$-noncrossing RNA structures without 2-arcs i.e. arcs of the form $(i,i+2)$,\nfor $1\\le i\\le n-2$.\n",

        "abstract": "  In this paper, we propose a novel inference method for dynamic genetic\nnetworks which makes it possible to face with a number of time measurements n\nmuch smaller than the number of genes p. The approach is based on the concept\nof low order conditional dependence graph that we extend here in the case of\nDynamic Bayesian Networks. Most of our results are based on the theory of\ngraphical models associated with the Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). In this\nway, we define a minimal DAG G which describes exactly the full order\nconditional dependencies given the past of the process. Then, to face with the\nlarge p and small n estimation case, we propose to approximate DAG G by\nconsidering low order conditional independencies. We introduce partial qth\norder conditional dependence DAGs G(q) and analyze their probabilistic\nproperties. In general, DAGs G(q) differ from DAG G but still reflect relevant\ndependence facts for sparse networks such as genetic networks. By using this\napproximation, we set out a non-bayesian inference method and demonstrate the\neffectiveness of this approach on both simulated and real data analysis. The\ninference procedure is implemented in the R package 'G1DBN' freely available\nfrom the CRAN archive.\n",

We study the percolative properties of the vacant set left\nby the interlacement at level u, which is an infinite, connected, translation\ninvariant random subset of Z^d. We introduce a critical value such that the\nvacant set percolates for u below the critical value, and does not percolate\nfor u above the critical value.

For the special case\nV=M=S_* pointed simplicial sets and L=S^1 this is the classical case of linear\nfunctors and has been described as the first stage of the Goodwillie tower of a\nhomotopy functor. We show, that our various model structures are compatible\nwith a closed symmetric monoidal product on small functors. We compare them\nwith other L-stabilizations described by Hovey, Jardine and others.

First, bundles of groups other than tori, even\nbundles of some nonabelian groups, can be dualized. Second, bundles whose duals\nare families of noncommutative groups (in the sense of noncommutative geometry)\ncan be treated, though in this case the base space of the bundles is best\nviewed as a topological stack.\n  Some methods developed for the construction may be of independent interest.\nThese are a Pontryagin type duality that interchanges commutative principal\nbundles with gerbes, a nonabelian Takai type duality for groupoids, and the\ncomputation of certain equivariant Brauer groups.\n",

        "abstract": "  The cycling operation is a special kind of conjugation that can be applied to\nelements in Artin's braid groups, in order to reduce their length. It is a key\ningredient of the usual solutions to the conjugacy problem in braid groups. In\ntheir seminal paper on braid-cryptography, Ko, Lee et al. proposed the {\\it\ncycling problem} as a hard problem in braid groups that could be interesting\nfor cryptography. In this paper we give a polynomial solution to that problem,\nmainly by showing that cycling is surjective, and using a result by Maffre\nwhich shows that pre-images under cycling can be computed fast. This result\nalso holds in every Artin-Tits group of spherical type.\n  On the other hand, the conjugacy search problem in braid groups is usually\nsolved by computing some finite sets called (left) ultra summit sets\n(left-USS), using left normal forms of braids. But one can equally use right\nnormal forms and compute right-USS's. Hard instances of the conjugacy search\nproblem correspond to elements having big (left and right) USS's. One may think\nthat even if some element has a big left-USS, it could possibly have a small\nright-USS. We show that this is not the case in the important particular case\nof rigid braids. More precisely, we show that the left-USS and the right-USS of\na given rigid braid determine isomorphic graphs, with the arrows reversed, the\nisomorphism being defined using iterated cycling. We conjecture that the same\nis true for every element, not necessarily rigid, in braid groups and\nArtin-Tits groups of spherical type.\n",

Applied to the\nSeiberg-Witten map, this formalism yields a new class of cohomotopy\nSeiberg-Witten invariants which have clear functorial properties with respect\nto diffeomorphisms of 4-manifolds. Our invariants and the Bauer-Furuta classes\nare directly comparable for 4-manifolds with $b_1=0$; they are equivalent when\n$b_1=0$ and $b_+>1$, but are finer in the case $b_1=0$, $b_+=1$ (they detect\nthe wall-crossing phenomena).\n  We study fundamental properties of the new invariants in a very general\nframework. In particular we prove a universal cohomotopy invariant jump formula\nand a multiplicative property. The formalism applies to other gauge theoretical\nproblems, e.g. to the theory of gauge theoretical (Hamiltonian) Gromov-Witten\ninvariants.\n",

For the most part\nwe consider an N-particle system but for certain of these formulas we can take\nthe limit as N goes to infinity. First we obtain, for the N-particle system, a\nformula for the probability of a configuration at time t, given the initial\nconfiguration. For this we use Bethe Ansatz ideas to solve the master equation,\nextending a result of Schuetz for the case N=2. The main results of the paper,\nderived from this, are integral formulas for the probability, for given initial\nconfiguration, that the m'th left-most particle is at x at time t. In one of\nthese formulas we can take the limit as N goes to infinity, and it gives the\nprobability for an infinite system where the initial configuration is bounded\non one side. For the special case of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion\nprocess (TASEP) our formulas reduce to the known ones.\n",

A half-duplex relay\nis considered that transmits on a channel orthogonal to that used by the\nsources. The instantaneous fading state between every transmit-receive pair in\nthis network is assumed to be known at both the transmitter and receiver. Under\nan average power constraint at each source and the relay, the sum-rate for the\nachievable strategy of decode-and-forward (DF) is maximized over all power\nallocations (policies) at the sources and relay. It is shown that the sum-rate\nmaximizing policy exploits the multiuser fading diversity to reveal the\noptimality of opportunistic channel use by each user. A geometric\ninterpretation of the optimal power policy is also presented.\n",

The source is coded\nin superimposed layers, with each layer successively refining the description\nin the previous one. The receiver decodes the layers that are supported by the\nchannel realization and reconstructs the source up to a distortion. In the\nlimit of a continuum of infinite layers, the optimal power distribution that\nminimizes the expected distortion is given by the solution to a set of linear\ndifferential equations in terms of the density of the fading distribution. In\nthe optimal power distribution, as SNR increases, the allocation over the\nhigher layers remains unchanged; rather the extra power is allocated towards\nthe lower layers. On the other hand, as the bandwidth ratio b (channel uses per\nsource symbol) tends to zero, the power distribution that minimizes expected\ndistortion converges to the power distribution that maximizes expected\ncapacity. While expected distortion can be improved by acquiring CSI at the\ntransmitter (CSIT) or by increasing diversity from the realization of\nindependent fading paths, at high SNR the performance benefit from diversity\nexceeds that from CSIT, especially when b is large.\n",

The mathematical formulation\nof the optimization problem is based on the postulated principle of equal\ndissipation rate during inelastic deformation. This principle leads to the\nenforcement of stress constraints in domains where inelastic deformation would\noccur. During the transition from the continuous structure to the truss-like\none (strut-and-tie model) the dissipation rate is kept constant using the\nprojected gradient method. The equal dissipation rate in the resulting truss\nand in the original continuous structure can be regarded as an equivalence\nstatement and suggests an alternative understanding of physical motivation\nbehind the strut-and-tie modeling. The performance of the proposed formulation\nis demonstrated with the help of two examples.\n",

We\nmodel this relation through a stochastic equation inspired by the original\ndefinition of PageRank.

The\ndifference between these two power laws is in a multiple coefficient, which\ndepends mainly on the fraction of dangling nodes, average in-degree, the power\nlaw exponent, and damping factor. The out-degree distribution has a minor\neffect, which we explicitly quantify. Our theoretical predictions show a good\nagreement with experimental data on three different samples of the Web.\n",

        "abstract": "  The dynamical discrete web (DDW), introduced in recent work of Howitt and\nWarren, is a system of coalescing simple symmetric one-dimensional random walks\nwhich evolve in an extra continuous dynamical parameter s. The evolution is by\nindependent updating of the underlying Bernoulli variables indexed by discrete\nspace-time that define the discrete web at any fixed s. In this paper, we study\nthe existence of exceptional (random) values of s where the paths of the web do\nnot behave like usual random walks and the Hausdorff dimension of the set of\nsuch exceptional s. Our results are motivated by those about exceptional times\nfor dynamical percolation in high dimension by H\\\"aggstrom, Peres and Steif,\nand in dimension two by Schramm and Steif. The exceptional behavior of the\nwalks in DDW is rather different from the situation for dynamical random walks\nof Benjamini, H\\\"aggstrom, Peres and Steif. In particular, we prove that there\nare exceptional values of s for which the walk from the origin S^s(n) has\nlimsup S^s(n)/\\sqrt n \\leq K with a nontrivial dependence of the Hausdorff\ndimension on K. We also discuss how these and other results extend to the\ndynamical Brownian web, a natural scaling limit of DDW. The scaling limit is\nthe focus of a paper in preparation; it was studied by Howitt and Warren and is\nrelated to the Brownian net of Sun and Swart.\n",

This leads to the concept of\nconstraint graphs. In Tverberg's theorem with constraints, we come up with a\nlist of constraints graphs for the topological Tverberg theorem.\n  The proof is based on connectivity results of chessboard-type complexes.\nMoreover, Tverberg's theorem with constraints implies new lower bounds for the\nnumber of Tverberg partitions. As a consequence, we prove Sierksma's conjecture\nfor $d=2$, and $q=3$.\n",

        "abstract": "  The diagram algebra introduced by Brauer that describes the centralizer\nalgebra on tensor products of the natural representation of an orthogonal group\nhas a presentation by generators and relations that only depends on the graph\nof type An on n nodes. Here we describe an algebra depending on an arbitrary\ngraph of type M. We study its structure when the type is An, Dn, E6, E7, E8. We\ndetermine the representations and find the dimensions. The algebra is\ngenerically semisimple and contains the group algebra of the Coxeter type M as\na subalgebra. It is a ring homomorphism of the Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebra of\nthese types. This fact will be used in later work determining the structure of\nBirman-Murakami-Wenzl algebras of simply laced spherical type.\n",

The\nrelation to previous work on networks of interacting queues is discussed and\nsubsequently, the stability and throughput regions of the system are analyzed\nand presented. A simple network of two source nodes and two destination nodes\nis considered first. The broadcast service process is analyzed assuming a\nchannel that allows for packet capture and multipacket reception. In this small\nnetwork, the stability and throughput regions are observed to coincide. The\nsame problem for a network with N sources and M destinations is considered\nnext. The channel model is simplified in that multipacket reception is no\nlonger permitted. Bounds on the stability region are developed using the\nconcept of stability rank and the throughput region of the system is compared\nto the bounds. Our results show that as the number of destination nodes\nincreases, the stability and throughput regions diminish. Additionally, a\nprevious conjecture that the stability and throughput regions coincide for a\nnetwork of arbitrarily many sources is supported for a broadcast scenario by\nthe results presented in this work.\n",

The achievable rate of Costa's dirty paper coding (DPC)\nscheme is calculated and compared to the case of the decoder's also knowing the\ndirt. In the ergodic case, the corresponding rate loss vanishes asymptotically\nin the limits of both high and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and is small at\nall finite SNR for typical distributions like Rayleigh, Rician, and Nakagami.\nIn the quasi-static case, the DPC scheme is lossless at all SNR in terms of\noutage probability. Quasi-static fading broadcast channels (BC) without\ntransmit channel state information (CSI) are investigated as an application of\nthe robustness properties. It is shown that the DPC scheme leads to an outage\nachievable rate region that strictly dominates that of time division.\n",

In this article, we study the twisted\nequivariant cohomology theory of Hamiltonian actions on $H$-twisted generalized\ncomplex manifolds. If the manifold satisfies the\n$\\bar{\\partial}\\partial$-lemma, we establish the equivariant formality theorem.\nIf in addition, the manifold satisfies the generalized K\\\"ahler condition, we\nprove the Kirwan injectivity in this setting. We then consider the Hamiltonian\naction of a torus on an $H$-twisted generalized Calabi-Yau manifold and extend\nto this case the Duistermaat-Heckman theorem for the push-forward measure.\n  As a side result, we show in this paper that the generalized K\\\"ahler\nquotient of a generalized K\\\"ahler vector space can never have a\n(cohomologically) non-trivial twisting.

In this article, we study the twisted\nequivariant cohomology theory of Hamiltonian actions on $H$-twisted generalized\ncomplex manifolds. If the manifold satisfies the\n$\\bar{\\partial}\\partial$-lemma, we establish the equivariant formality theorem.\nIf in addition, the manifold satisfies the generalized K\\\"ahler condition, we\nprove the Kirwan injectivity in this setting. We then consider the Hamiltonian\naction of a torus on an $H$-twisted generalized Calabi-Yau manifold and extend\nto this case the Duistermaat-Heckman theorem for the push-forward measure.\n  As a side result, we show in this paper that the generalized K\\\"ahler\nquotient of a generalized K\\\"ahler vector space can never have a\n(cohomologically) non-trivial twisting. This gives a negative answer to a\nquestion asked by physicists whether one can construct $(2,2)$ gauged linear\nsigma models with non-trivial fluxes.\n",

The aim is to find the optimal rates at which\nthe sources should be compressed and the network flows using which they should\nbe transmitted so that the cost of the transmission is minimal. We consider\nnetworks with capacity constraints and linear cost functions. The problem is\ncomplicated by the fact that the description of the feasible rate region of\ndistributed source coding problems typically has a number of constraints that\nis exponential in the number of sources. This renders general purpose solvers\ninefficient. We present a framework in which these problems can be solved\nefficiently by exploiting the structure of the feasible rate regions coupled\nwith dual decomposition and optimization techniques such as the subgradient\nmethod and the proximal bundle method.\n",

This is\nan improvement over the proof using one-point Algebraic-Geometric codes given\nin \\cite{PW2005}.

Our algorithm achieves a\nrelative error correction radius of $\\tau \\leq \\prod_{i=1}^m (1 -\n\\sqrt{k_i/q})$.

        "abstract": "  In wireless ad hoc networks, distributed nodes can collaboratively form an\nantenna array for long-distance communications to achieve high energy\nefficiency. In recent work, Ochiai, et al., have shown that such collaborative\nbeamforming can achieve a statistically nice beampattern with a narrow main\nlobe and low sidelobes. However, the process of collaboration introduces\nsignificant delay, since all collaborating nodes need access to the same\ninformation. In this paper, a technique that significantly reduces the\ncollaboration overhead is proposed. It consists of two phases. In the first\nphase, nodes transmit locally in a random access fashion. Collisions, when they\noccur, are viewed as linear mixtures of the collided packets. In the second\nphase, a set of cooperating nodes acts as a distributed antenna system and\nbeamform the received analog waveform to one or more faraway destinations. This\nstep requires multiplication of the received analog waveform by a complex\nnumber, which is independently computed by each cooperating node, and which\nenables separation of the collided packets based on their final destination.\nThe scheme requires that each node has global knowledge of the network\ncoordinates. The proposed scheme can achieve high throughput, which in certain\ncases exceeds one.\n",

As one of the\napplications, we show that in the case of a single curve $C$ this action\ninduces a integral form of a Lefschetz $\\operatorname{sl}_2$-action on the Chow\ngroups of $C^{[N]}$. Another application gives a new grading on the ring of\n0-cycles on the Jacobian $J$ of $C$ (with respect to the Pontryagin product)\nand equips it with an action of the Lie algebra of vector fields on the line.\nWe also define the groups of tautological classes in $CH^*({\\cal\nC}^{[\\bullet]})$ and in $CH^*({\\cal J})$ and prove for them analogs of the\nproperties established in the case of the Jacobian of a single curve by\nBeauville in math.AG/0204188.

We show that, although the direct quantum\n(physical) reduction (based on using the scales of quantum mechanics) is\nmeaningless, one may apply so called quantum-like models. In our approach\nquantum-like probabilistic behaviour is a consequence of contextualy of\nstatistical data in finances (and economics in general). However, our\nhypothesis on \"quantumness\" of financial data should be tested experimentally\n(as opposed to the conventional description based on the noncontextual\nclassical probabilistic approach).

The reduced vector field has a remarkable hydrodynamic interpretation:\nit is a velocity field for a stationary flow of an ideal fluid. Right- or\nleft-invariant symmetry fields of the reduced field define vortex manifolds for\nsuch flows.\n  Consider now a mechanical system, whose configuration space is a Lie group\nand whose Lagrangian is invariant to left translations on that group, and\nassume that the mass geometry of the system may change under the action of\ninternal control forces. Such system can also be reduced to the Lie group. With\nno controls, this mechanical system describes a geodesic flow of the\nleft-invariant metric, given by the Lagrangian, and thus its reduced flow is a\nstationary ideal fluid flow on the Lie group. The standard control problem for\nsuch system is to find the conditions, under which the system can be brought\nfrom any initial position in the configuration space to another preassigned\nposition by changing its mass geometry. We show that under these conditions, by\nchanging the mass geometry, one can also bring one vortex manifold to any other\npreassigned vortex manifold.\n",

We are\ninterested in routes for the information flow through the relays that achieve\nthe highest DF rate. We first construct an algorithm that provably finds\noptimal DF routes. As the algorithm runs in factorial time in the worst case,\nwe propose a polynomial time heuristic algorithm that finds an optimal route\nwith high probability. We demonstrate that that the optimal (and near optimal)\nDF routes are good in practice by simulating a distributed DF coding scheme\nusing low density parity check codes with puncturing and incremental\nredundancy.\n",

The aim\nof this article is to prove a very basic theorem on regular (a,b)-modules\nshowing that a given regular (a,b)-module is completely characterized by some\n''finite order jet'' of its structure. Moreover a very simple bound for such a\nsufficient order is given in term of the rank and of two very simple invariants\n: the regularity order which count the number of times you need to apply \\\n$b^{-1}.a \\simeq \\partial_z.z$ in order to reach a simple pole (a,b)-module.\nThe second invariant is the ''width'' which corresponds, in the simple pole\ncase, to the maximal integral difference between to eigenvalues of $b^{-1}.a$\n  (the logarithm of the monodromy). In the computation of examples this theorem\nis quite helpfull because it tells you at which power of $b$ in the expansions\nyou may stop without loosing any information.\n",

In\nfairly general conditions, it has been shown that these systems can achieve the\ndiversity order of an equivalent MISO channel and, if the node geometry\npermits, virtually the same outage probability can be achieved as that of the\nequivalent MISO channel for a wide range of applicable SNR. However, much of\nthe prior analysis has been performed under the assumption of perfect timing\nand frequency offset synchronization. In this paper, we derive the estimation\nbounds and associated maximum likelihood estimators for frequency offset\nestimation in a cooperative communication system. We show the benefit of\nadaptively tuning the frequency of the relay node in order to reduce estimation\nerror at the destination. We also derive an efficient estimation algorithm,\nbased on the correlation sequence of the data, which has mean squared error\nclose to the Cramer-Rao Bound.\n",

        "abstract": "  In the theory of operads we consider functors of generalized symmetric powers\ndefined by sums of coinvariant modules under actions of symmetric groups. One\nobserves classically that the construction of symmetric functors provides an\nisomorphism from the category of symmetric modules to a subcategory of the\ncategory of functors on the base category. The purpose of this book is to\nobtain a similar relationship for functors on a category of algebras over an\noperad.\n  We observe that right modules over operads, symmetric modules equipped with a\nright operad action, give rise to functors on categories of algebras and we\nprove that this construction yields an embedding of categories. Then we check\nthat right modules over operads form a model category. In addition we prove\nthat weak-equivalences of right modules correspond to pointwise\nweak-equivalences at the functor level. As a conclusion, we obtain that right\nmodules over operads supply good models for the homotopy of associated functors\non algebras over operads.\n",

        "abstract": "  This work examines the problem of sequential detection of a change in the\ndrift of a Brownian motion in the case of two-sided alternatives. Applications\nto real life situations in which two-sided changes can occur are discussed.\nTraditionally, 2-CUSUM stopping rules have been used for this problem due to\ntheir asymptotically optimal character as the mean time between false alarms\ntends to $\\infty$. In particular, attention has focused on 2-CUSUM harmonic\nmean rules due to the simplicity in calculating their first moments. In this\npaper, we derive closed-form expressions for the first moment of a general\n2-CUSUM stopping rule. We use these expressions to obtain explicit upper and\nlower bounds for it. Moreover, we derive an expression for the rate of change\nof this first moment as one of the threshold parameters changes. Based on these\nexpressions we obtain explicit upper and lower bounds to this rate of change.\nUsing these expressions we are able to find the best 2-CUSUM stopping rule with\nrespect to the extended Lorden criterion. In fact, we demonstrate not only the\nexistence but also the uniqueness of the best 2-CUSUM stopping both in the case\nof a symmetric change and in the case of a non-symmetric case. Furthermore, we\ndiscuss the existence of a modification of the 2-CUSUM stopping rule that has a\nstrictly better performance than its classical 2-CUSUM counterpart for small\nvalues of the mean time between false alarms. We conclude with a discussion on\nthe open problem of strict optimality in the case of two-sided alternatives.\n",

        "abstract": "  Splitting trees are those random trees where individuals give birth at\nconstant rate during a lifetime with general distribution, to i.i.d. copies of\nthemselves. The width process of a splitting tree is then a binary, homogeneous\nCrump--Mode--Jagers (CMJ) process, and is not Markovian unless the lifetime\ndistribution is exponential. Here, we allow the birth rate to be infinite, that\nis, pairs of birth times and lifespans of newborns form a Poisson point process\nalong the lifetime of their mother, with possibly infinite intensity measure. A\nsplitting tree is a random (so-called) chronological tree. Each element of a\nchronological tree is a (so-called) existence point $(v,\\tau)$ of some\nindividual $v$ (vertex) in a discrete tree, where $\\tau$ is a nonnegative real\nnumber called chronological level (time). We introduce a total order on\nexistence points, called linear order, and a mapping $\\varphi$ from the tree\ninto the real line which preserves this order. The inverse of $\\varphi$ is\ncalled the exploration process, and the projection of this inverse on\nchronological levels the contour process. For splitting trees truncated up to\nlevel $\\tau$, we prove that thus defined contour process is a L\\'evy process\nreflected below $\\tau$ and killed upon hitting 0. This allows to derive\nproperties of (i) splitting trees: conceptual proof of Le Gall--Le Jan's\ntheorem in the finite variation case, exceptional points, coalescent point\nprocess, age distribution; (ii) CMJ processes: one-dimensional marginals,\nconditionings, limit theorems, asymptotic numbers of individuals with infinite\nvs finite descendances.\n",

The solution of the problem is given in terms of Bell\nand Stirling numbers enumerating partitions of a set. This framework reveals\nseveral inherent relations between ordering problems and combinatorial objects,\nand displays the analytical background to Wick's theorem.

The different\ntime evolution of these volumes can be used to identify rapidly and efficiently\nthe nature of the dynamics, leading to the introduction of quantities that\nclearly distinguish between chaotic behavior and quasiperiodic motion on\n$N$-dimensional tori. More specifically we introduce the Generalized Alignment\nIndex of order $k$ (GALI$_k$) as the volume of a generalized parallelepiped,\nwhose edges are $k$ initially linearly independent unit deviation vectors from\nthe studied orbit whose magnitude is normalized to unity at every time step.\nThe GALI$_k$ is a generalization of the Smaller Alignment Index (SALI)\n(GALI$_2$ $\\propto$ SALI). However, GALI$_k$ provides significantly more\ndetailed information on the local dynamics, allows for a faster and clearer\ndistinction between order and chaos than SALI and works even in cases where the\nSALI method is inconclusive.\n",

        "abstract": "  Motivated by the Dobrushin uniqueness theorem in statistical mechanics, we\nconsider the following situation: Let \\alpha be a nonnegative matrix over a\nfinite or countably infinite index set X, and define the \"cleaning operators\"\n\\beta_h = I_{1-h} + I_h \\alpha for h: X \\to [0,1] (here I_f denotes the\ndiagonal matrix with entries f). We ask: For which \"cleaning sequences\" h_1,\nh_2, ... do we have c \\beta_{h_1} ... \\beta_{h_n} \\to 0 for a suitable class of\n\"dirt vectors\" c? We show, under a modest condition on \\alpha, that this occurs\nwhenever \\sum_i h_i = \\infty everywhere on X. More generally, we analyze the\ncleaning of subsets \\Lambda \\subseteq X and the final distribution of dirt on\nthe complement of \\Lambda. We show that when supp(h_i) \\subseteq \\Lambda with\n\\sum_i h_i = \\infty everywhere on \\Lambda, the operators \\beta_{h_1} ...\n\\beta_{h_n} converge as n \\to \\infty to the \"balayage operator\" \\Pi_\\Lambda =\n\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty (I_\\Lambda \\alpha)^k I_{\\Lambda^c). These results are\nobtained in two ways: by a fairly simple matrix formalism, and by a more\npowerful tree formalism that corresponds to working with formal power series in\nwhich the matrix elements of \\alpha are treated as noncommuting indeterminates.\n",

We show that an algorithm relying on floating point\nevaluation of modular functions and on interpolation, which has received little\nattention in the literature, has a complexity that is essentially (up to\nlogarithmic factors) linear in the size of the computed polynomials. In\nparticular, it obtains the classical modular polynomials $\\Phi_\\ell$ of prime\nlevel $\\ell$ in time O (\\ell^3 \\log^4 \\ell \\log \\log \\ell). Besides treating\nmodular polynomials for $\\Gamma^0 (\\ell)$, which are an important ingredient in\nmany algorithms dealing with isogenies of elliptic curves, the algorithm is\neasily adapted to more general situations. Composite levels are handled just as\neasily as prime levels, as well as polynomials between a modular function and\nits transform of prime level, such as the Schl\\\"afli polynomials and their\ngeneralisations. Our distributed implementation of the algorithm confirms the\ntheoretical analysis by computing modular equations of record level around\n10000 in less than two weeks on ten processors.\n",

It is proved that, in\nboth cases, the stability condition only involves the component codes with\nminimum distance 2. The stability condition for GLDPC codes is always expressed\nas an upper bound to the decoding threshold. This is not possible for D-GLDPC\ncodes, unless all the generalized variable nodes have minimum distance at least\n3. Furthermore, a condition called derivative matching is defined in the paper.\nThis condition is sufficient for a GLDPC or DGLDPC code to achieve the\nstability condition with equality. If this condition is satisfied, the\nthreshold of D-GLDPC codes (whose generalized variable nodes have all minimum\ndistance at least 3) and GLDPC codes can be expressed in closed form.\n",

The case of covers\nof the projective line branched only over the points 0, 1, and infinity,\nthrough Belyi's theorem, leads to Grothendieck's dessins d'enfants program for\nunderstanding the absolute Galois group through its faithful action on such\ncovers. This note is motivated by Catanese's question about a\nhigher-dimensional analogue: does the absolute Galois group act faithfully on\nthe deformation equivalence classes of smooth surfaces? (These equivalence\nclasses are of course by definition the strongest deformation invariants.) We\ngive a short proof of a weaker result: the absolute Galois group acts\nfaithfully on the irreducible components of the moduli space of smooth surfaces\n(of general type, canonically polarized). Bauer, Catanese, and Grunewald have\nrecently answered Catanese's original question using a different construction.\n",

A fully automatic and adaptive implementation of a\ndensity and hazard rate estimator is proposed for randomly right censored data.\nCareful selection of the bandwidth in the proposed estimators yields estimates\nthat are more efficient in terms of overall mean squared error performance, and\nin some cases achieves a nearly parametric convergence rate. Additionally,\nrapidly converging bandwidth estimates are presented for use in second-order\nkernels to supplement such kernel-based methods in hazard rate estimation.\nSimulations illustrate the improved accuracy of the proposed estimator against\nother nonparametric estimators of the density and hazard function.

We introduce a new equivalence\nrelation on spatial graphs called component homotopy, which reduces to link\nhomotopy in the classical case. Unlike previous attempts at generalizing link\nhomotopy to spatial graphs, our new relation allows analogues of some standard\nlink homotopy results and invariants.\n  In particular we can define a type of Milnor group for a spatial graph under\ncomponent homotopy, and this group determines whether or not the spatial graph\nis splittable. More surprisingly, we will also show that whether the spatial\ngraph is splittable up to component homotopy depends only on the link homotopy\nclass of the links contained within it. Numerical invariants of the relation\nwill also be produced.\n",

We highlight a fundamental asymptotic limit of sample eigenvalue based\ndetection of weak high-dimensional signals from a limited sample size and\ndiscuss its implication for the detection of two closely spaced signals.\n  This motivates our heuristic definition of the 'effective number of\nidentifiable signals.' Numerical simulations are used to demonstrate the\nconsistency of the algorithm with respect to the effective number of signals\nand the superior performance of the algorithm with respect to Wax and Kailath's\n\"asymptotically consistent\" MDL based estimator.\n",

        "abstract": "  In wireless packet-forwarding networks with selfish nodes, applications of a\nrepeated game can induce the nodes to forward each others' packets, so that the\nnetwork performance can be improved. However, the nodes on the boundary of such\nnetworks cannot benefit from this strategy, as the other nodes do not depend on\nthem. This problem is sometimes known as the curse of the boundary nodes. To\novercome this problem, an approach based on coalition games is proposed, in\nwhich the boundary nodes can use cooperative transmission to help the backbone\nnodes in the middle of the network. In return, the backbone nodes are willing\nto forward the boundary nodes' packets. The stability of the coalitions is\nstudied using the concept of a core. Then two types of fairness, namely, the\nmin-max fairness using nucleolus and the average fairness using the Shapley\nfunction are investigated. Finally, a protocol is designed using both repeated\ngames and coalition games. Simulation results show how boundary nodes and\nbackbone nodes form coalitions together according to different fairness\ncriteria. The proposed protocol can improve the network connectivity by about\n50%, compared with pure repeated game schemes.\n",

In addition, if they are\ndirect, then they lie over only attracting periodic points of $f$, and\nmoreover, if $f$ is a polynomial, then both direct and indirect singularities\nlie over attracting, parabolic and Cremer periodic points of $f$. We also\nobtain concrete examples of both kinds of transcendental singularities of\nSchr\\\"oder maps as well as a new proof of the Pommerenke-Levin-Yoccoz\ninequality and a new formulation of the Fatou conjecture.\n",

Extending the lifetime of\nnetworks composed of battery-operated nodes is a key issue in the design and\noperation of wireless sensor networks. This paper considers the effects on\nnetwork lifetime of allowing closely located nodes to use CB/CT to reduce the\nload or even to avoid packet-forwarding requests to nodes that have critical\nbattery life. First, the effectiveness of CB/CT in improving the signal\nstrength at a faraway destination using energy in nearby nodes is studied.\nThen, the performance improvement obtained by this technique is analyzed for a\nspecial 2D disk case. Further, for general networks in which\ninformation-generation rates are fixed, a new routing problem is formulated as\na linear programming problem, while for other general networks, the cost for\nrouting is dynamically adjusted according to the amount of energy remaining and\nthe effectiveness of CB/CT. From the analysis and the simulation results, it is\nseen that the proposed method can reduce the payloads of energy-depleting nodes\nby about 90% in the special case network considered and improve the lifetimes\nof general networks by about 10%, compared with existing techniques.\n",

        "abstract": "  Extending network lifetime of battery-operated devices is a key design issue\nthat allows uninterrupted information exchange among distributive nodes in\nwireless sensor networks. Collaborative beamforming (CB) and cooperative\ntransmission (CT) have recently emerged as new communication techniques that\nenable and leverage effective resource sharing among collaborative/cooperative\nnodes. In this paper, we seek to maximize the lifetime of sensor networks by\nusing the new idea that closely located nodes can use CB/CT to reduce the load\nor even avoid packet forwarding requests to nodes that have critical battery\nlife. First, we study the effectiveness of CB/CT to improve the signal strength\nat a faraway destination using energy in nearby nodes. Then, a 2D disk case is\nanalyzed to assess the resulting performance improvement. For general networks,\nif information-generation rates are fixed, the new routing problem is\nformulated as a linear programming problem; otherwise, the cost for routing is\ndynamically adjusted according to the amount of energy remaining and the\neffectiveness of CB/CT. From the analysis and simulation results, it is seen\nthat the proposed schemes can improve the lifetime by about 90% in the 2D disk\nnetwork and by about 10% in the general networks, compared to existing schemes.\n",

        "abstract": "  An extensive literature exists describing various techniques for the\nevaluation of Hankel determinants. The prevailing methods such as Dodgson\ncondensation, continued fraction expansion, LU decomposition, all produce\nproduct formulas when they are applicable. We mention the classic case of the\nHankel determinants with binomial entries ${3k+2 \\choose k}$ and those with\nentries ${3k \\choose k}$; both of these classes of Hankel determinants have\nproduct form evaluations. The intermediate case, ${3k+1 \\choose k}$ has not\nbeen evaluated. There is a good reason for this: these latter determinants do\nnot have product form evaluations.\n  In this paper we evaluate the Hankel determinant of ${3k+1 \\choose k}$. The\nevaluation is a sum of a small number of products, an almost product.\n  The method actually provides more, and as applications, we present the\nsalient points for the evaluation of a number of other Hankel determinants with\npolynomial entries, along with product and almost product form evaluations at\nspecial points.\n",

        "abstract": "  Cooperative transmission is an emerging communication technique that takes\nadvantages of the broadcast nature of wireless channels. However, due to low\nspectral efficiency and the requirement of orthogonal channels, its potential\nfor use in future wireless networks is limited. In this paper, by making use of\nmultiuser detection (MUD) and network coding, cooperative transmission\nprotocols with high spectral efficiency, diversity order, and coding gain are\ndeveloped. Compared with the traditional cooperative transmission protocols\nwith single-user detection, in which the diversity gain is only for one source\nuser, the proposed MUD cooperative transmission protocols have the merits that\nthe improvement of one user's link can also benefit the other users. In\naddition, using MUD at the relay provides an environment in which network\ncoding can be employed. The coding gain and high diversity order can be\nobtained by fully utilizing the link between the relay and the destination.\n  From the analysis and simulation results, it is seen that the proposed\nprotocols achieve higher diversity gain, better asymptotic efficiency, and\nlower bit error rate, compared to traditional MUD and to existing cooperative\ntransmission protocols.\n",

Our results are based on the\nanalysis of the \"Jensen channel\" associated to a given selective-fading MIMO\nchannel. While the original problem seems analytically intractable due to the\nmutual information being a sum of correlated random variables, the Jensen\nchannel is equivalent to the original channel in the sense of the DM-tradeoff\nand lends itself nicely to analytical treatment.

        "abstract": "  Distributed estimation based on measurements from multiple wireless sensors\nis investigated. It is assumed that a group of sensors observe the same\nquantity in independent additive observation noises with possibly different\nvariances. The observations are transmitted using amplify-and-forward (analog)\ntransmissions over non-ideal fading wireless channels from the sensors to a\nfusion center, where they are combined to generate an estimate of the observed\nquantity. Assuming that the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE) is used by\nthe fusion center, the equal-power transmission strategy is first discussed,\nwhere the system performance is analyzed by introducing the concept of\nestimation outage and estimation diversity, and it is shown that there is an\nachievable diversity gain on the order of the number of sensors. The optimal\npower allocation strategies are then considered for two cases: minimum\ndistortion under power constraints; and minimum power under distortion\nconstraints. In the first case, it is shown that by turning off bad sensors,\ni.e., sensors with bad channels and bad observation quality, adaptive power\ngain can be achieved without sacrificing diversity gain. Here, the adaptive\npower gain is similar to the array gain achieved in Multiple-Input\nSingle-Output (MISO) multi-antenna systems when channel conditions are known to\nthe transmitter. In the second case, the sum power is minimized under\nzero-outage estimation distortion constraint, and some related energy\nefficiency issues in sensor networks are discussed.\n",

        "abstract": "  In time hopping impulse radio, $N_f$ pulses of duration $T_c$ are transmitted\nfor each information symbol. This gives rise to two types of processing gain:\n(i) pulse combining gain, which is a factor $N_f$, and (ii) pulse spreading\ngain, which is $N_c=T_f/T_c$, where $T_f$ is the mean interval between two\nsubsequent pulses. This paper investigates the trade-off between these two\ntypes of processing gain in the presence of timing jitter. First, an additive\nwhite Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel is considered and approximate closed form\nexpressions for bit error probability are derived for impulse radio systems\nwith and without pulse-based polarity randomization. Both symbol-synchronous\nand chip-synchronous scenarios are considered. The effects of multiple-access\ninterference and timing jitter on the selection of optimal system parameters\nare explained through theoretical analysis. Finally, a multipath scenario is\nconsidered and the trade-off between processing gains of a synchronous impulse\nradio system with pulse-based polarity randomization is analyzed. The effects\nof the timing jitter, multiple-access interference and inter-frame interference\nare investigated. Simulation studies support the theoretical results.\n",

This arrangement has a complex constraint involving the sines of its\nangles. These constraints cannot be satisfied by any projection of the initial\narrangement. This is sufficient to prove Pappus's theorem. The derivation of\nthe constraint is via systems of inequalities arising from the polar\ncoordinates of the lines. These systems are linear in r for any given theta,\nand their solubility can be analysed in terms of the signs of determinants. The\nevaluation of the determinants is via a normal form for sums of products of\nsines, giving a powerful system of trigonometric identities. The particular\nresult is generalized to arrangements derived from three edge connected totally\ncyclic directed graphs, conjectured to be sufficient for a complete analysis of\nangle constraining arrangements of lines, and thus a full response to Ringel's\nslope conjecture. These methods are generally applicable to the realizability\nproblem for rank 3 oriented matroids.\n",

        "abstract": "  In this paper we address the problem of finding the sensing capacity of\nsensor networks for a class of linear observation models and a fixed SNR\nregime. Sensing capacity is defined as the maximum number of signal dimensions\nreliably identified per sensor observation. In this context sparsity of the\nphenomena is a key feature that determines sensing capacity. Precluding the SNR\nof the environment the effect of sparsity on the number of measurements\nrequired for accurate reconstruction of a sparse phenomena has been widely\ndealt with under compressed sensing. Nevertheless the development there was\nmotivated from an algorithmic perspective. In this paper our aim is to derive\nthese bounds in an information theoretic set-up and thus provide algorithm\nindependent conditions for reliable reconstruction of sparse signals. In this\ndirection we first generalize the Fano's inequality and provide lower bounds to\nthe probability of error in reconstruction subject to an arbitrary distortion\ncriteria. Using these lower bounds to the probability of error, we derive upper\nbounds to sensing capacity and show that for fixed SNR regime sensing capacity\ngoes down to zero as sparsity goes down to zero. This means that\ndisproportionately more sensors are required to monitor very sparse events. Our\nnext main contribution is that we show the effect of sensing diversity on\nsensing capacity, an effect that has not been considered before. Sensing\ndiversity is related to the effective \\emph{coverage} of a sensor with respect\nto the field. In this direction we show the following results (a) Sensing\ncapacity goes down as sensing diversity per sensor goes down; (b) Random\nsampling (coverage) of the field by sensors is better than contiguous location\nsampling (coverage).\n",

        "abstract": "  An operator theoretic approach to orthogonal rational functions on the unit\ncircle with poles in its exterior is presented in this paper. This approach is\nbased on the identification of a suitable matrix representation of the\nmultiplication operator associated with the corresponding orthogonality\nmeasure. Two different alternatives are discussed, depending whether we use for\nthe matrix representation the standard basis of orthogonal rational functions,\nor a new one with poles alternatively located in the exterior and the interior\nof the unit circle. The corresponding representations are linear fractional\ntransformations with matrix coefficients acting respectively on Hessenberg and\nfive-diagonal unitary matrices.\n  In consequence, the orthogonality measure can be recovered from the spectral\nmeasure of an infinite unitary matrix depending uniquely on the poles and the\nparameters of the recurrence relation for the orthogonal rational functions.\nBesides, the zeros of the orthogonal and para-orthogonal rational functions are\nidentified as the eigenvalues of matrix linear fractional transformations of\nfinite Hessenberg and five-diagonal matrices.\n  As an application of this operator approach, we obtain new relations between\nthe support of the orthogonality measure and the location of the poles and\nparameters of the recurrence relation, generalizing to the rational case known\nresults for orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle.\n  Finally, we extend these results to orthogonal polynomials on the real line\nwith poles in the lower half plane.\n",

On the other hand we explain\nthat for a certain class of groups -- in particular hyperbolic groups -- these\ntwo properties are equivalent. In the course of our discussion, we introduce an\nintrinsic property of the group -- that we called the U-property -- which says\nquantitatively how the norm an element is controlled by the translation length\nof finitely many related conjugacy classes.

The avoidance\nof one, two or three patterns has already been considered. Here, the cases of\nfour and five forbidden patterns are solved and the exact enumeration of the\npermutations avoiding them is given, confirming the conjectures of Claesson and\nMansour. The approach we use can be easily extended to the cases of more than\nfive forbidden patterns.\n",

The design maintains the\nadvantages of the classic OSI model, while accounting for the cross-coupling\nbetween layers, through information sharing. The proposed joint power control\nand routing algorithm is shown to increase significantly the overall energy\nefficiency of the network, at the expense of a moderate increase in complexity.\nPerformance enhancement of the joint design using multiuser detection is also\ninvestigated, and it is shown that the use of multiuser detection can increase\nthe capacity of the ad hoc network significantly for a given level of energy\nconsumption.\n",

The first is\nthe evaluation of the total integral of the Hastings-McLeod solution of the\nPainlev\\'e II equation. The second is the evaluation of the constant term of\nthe asymptotic expansions of the Tracy-Widom distribution functions as the\ndistribution parameter approaches minus infinity. For the GUE Tracy-Widom\ndistribution function, this gives an alternative proof of the recent work of\nDeift, Its, and Krasovsky. The constant terms for the GOE and GSE Tracy-Widom\ndistribution functions are new.\n",

The transmitters\ncooperate by first exchanging messages over an orthogonal transmitter\ncooperation channel, then encoding jointly with dirty paper coding. The\nreceivers cooperate by using Wyner-Ziv compress-and-forward over an analogous\northogonal receiver cooperation channel. To account for the cost of\ncooperation, the allocation of network power and bandwidth among the data and\ncooperation channels is studied. It is shown that transmitter cooperation\noutperforms receiver cooperation and improves capacity over non-cooperative\ntransmission under most operating conditions when the cooperation channel is\nstrong. However, a weak cooperation channel limits the transmitter cooperation\nrate; in this case receiver cooperation is more advantageous.\nTransmitter-and-receiver cooperation offers sizable additional capacity gain\nover transmitter-only cooperation at low SNR, whereas at high SNR transmitter\ncooperation alone captures most of the cooperative capacity improvement.\n",

The method consists in sorting or\nmonotone rearranging the original estimated non-monotone curve into a monotone\nrearranged curve. We show that the rearranged curve is closer to the true\nquantile curve in finite samples than the original curve, establish a\nfunctional delta method for rearrangement-related operators, and derive\nfunctional limit theory for the entire rearranged curve and its functionals. We\nalso establish validity of the bootstrap for estimating the limit law of the\nthe entire rearranged curve and its functionals. Our limit results are generic\nin that they apply to every estimator of a monotone econometric function,\nprovided that the estimator satisfies a functional central limit theorem and\nthe function satisfies some smoothness conditions. Consequently, our results\napply to estimation of other econometric functions with monotonicity\nrestrictions, such as demand, production, distribution, and structural\ndistribution functions. We illustrate the results with an application to\nestimation of structural quantile functions using data on Vietnam veteran\nstatus and earnings.\n",

The problem is parameterised by a finite set F of non-negative\nfunctions that may be used to assign weights to the configurations (feasible\nsolutions) of a problem instance. Classical constraint satisfaction problems\ncorrespond to the special case of 0,1-valued functions. We show that the\npartition function, i.e. the sum of the weights of all configurations, can be\ncomputed in polynomial time if either (1) every function in F is of ``product\ntype'', or (2) every function in F is ``pure affine''. For every other fixed\nset F, computing the partition function is FP^{#P}-complete.\n",

These lattices\nare ordered by inclusion: the Stanley lattice is an extension of the Tamari\nlattice which is an extension of the Kreweras lattice. The Stanley order can be\ndefined on the set of Dyck paths of size $n$ as the relation of \\emph{being\nabove}. Hence, intervals in the Stanley lattice are pairs of non-crossing Dyck\npaths. In a former article, the second author defined a bijection $\\Phi$\nbetween pairs of non-crossing Dyck paths and the realizers of triangulations\n(or Schnyder woods). We give a simpler description of the bijection $\\Phi$.\nThen, we study the restriction of $\\Phi$ to Tamari's and Kreweras' intervals.\nWe prove that $\\Phi$ induces a bijection between Tamari intervals and minimal\nrealizers. This gives a bijection between Tamari intervals and triangulations.\nWe also prove that $\\Phi$ induces a bijection between Kreweras intervals and\nthe (unique) realizers of stack triangulations. Thus, $\\Phi$ induces a\nbijection between Kreweras intervals and stack triangulations which are known\nto be in bijection with ternary trees.\n",

        "abstract": "  Consider the partition function of a directed polymer in an IID field. We\nassume that both tails of the negative and the positive part of the field are\nat least as light as exponential. It is a well-known fact that the free energy\nof the polymer is equal to a deterministic constant for almost every\nrealization of the field and that the upper tail of the large deviations is\nexponential. The lower tail of the large deviations is typically lighter than\nexponential. In this paper we provide a method to obtain estimates on the rate\nof decay of the lower tail of the large deviations, which are sharp up to\nmultiplicative constants. As a consequence, we show that the lower tail of the\nlarge deviations exhibits three regimes, determined according to the tail of\nthe negative part of the field. Our method is simple to apply and can be used\nto cover other oriented and non-oriented models including first/last-passage\npercolation and the parabolic Anderson model\n",

        "abstract": "  Controlled Lagrangian and matching techniques are developed for the\nstabilization of relative equilibria and equilibria of discrete mechanical\nsystems with symmetry as well as broken symmetry. Interesting new phenomena\narise in the controlled Lagrangian approach in the discrete context that are\nnot present in the continuous theory. In particular, to make the discrete\ntheory effective, one can make an appropriate selection of momentum levels or,\nalternatively, introduce a new parameter into the controlled Lagrangian to\ncomplete the kinetic matching procedure. Specifically, new terms in the\ncontrolled shape equation that are necessary for potential matching in the\ndiscrete setting are introduced. The theory is illustrated with the problem of\nstabilization of the cart-pendulum system on an incline. The paper also\ndiscusses digital and model predictive controllers.\n",

It\nis shown that in order to maximize its utility (in bits per joule), a user must\nchoose the lowest constellation size that can accommodate the user's delay\nconstraint. Using this framework, the tradeoffs among energy efficiency, delay,\nthroughput and constellation size are also studied and quantified.

In the proposed game, each user seeks to choose its\ntransmit power and rate in a distributed manner in order to maximize its own\nutility while satisfying its QoS requirements. The user's QoS constraints are\nspecified in terms of the average source rate and an upper bound on the average\ndelay where the delay includes both transmission and queuing delays.

The Nash equilibrium\nsolution for the proposed non-cooperative game is derived and a closed-form\nexpression for the utility achieved at equilibrium is obtained. It is shown\nthat the QoS requirements of a user translate into a \"size\" for the user which\nis an indication of the amount of network resources consumed by the user. Using\nthis competitive multiuser framework, the tradeoffs among throughput, delay,\nnetwork capacity and energy efficiency are studied.

The approach is applicable to a\nlarge family of multiuser receivers including the matched filter, the\ndecorrelator, the linear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) receiver, and the\n(nonlinear) optimal detectors. It exploits the linear relationship that has\nbeen shown to exist between the transmit power and the output\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SIR) in the large-system limit. It is\nshown that, for this family of receivers, when users seek to selfishly maximize\ntheir own energy efficiency, the Nash equilibrium is SIR-balanced. In addition,\na unified power control (UPC) algorithm for reaching the Nash equilibrium is\nproposed. The algorithm adjusts the user's transmit powers by iteratively\ncomputing the large-system multiuser efficiency, which is independent of\ninstantaneous spreading sequences. The convergence of the algorithm is proved\nfor the matched filter, the decorrelator, and the MMSE receiver, and is\ndemonstrated by means of simulation for an optimal detector. Moreover, the\nperformance of the algorithm in finite-size systems is studied and compared\nwith that of a conventional power control scheme, in which user powers depend\non the instantaneous spreading sequences.\n",

        "abstract": "  In this two-part paper, we consider the multiantenna multihop relay channels\nin which the source signal arrives at the destination through N independent\nrelaying hops in series. The main concern of this work is to design relaying\nstrategies that utilize efficiently the relays in such a way that the diversity\nis maximized. In part I, we focus on the amplify-and-forward (AF) strategy with\nwhich the relays simply scale the received signal and retransmit it. More\nspecifically, we characterize the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of the\nAF scheme in a general multihop channel with arbitrary number of antennas and\narbitrary number of hops. The DMT is in closed-form expression as a function of\nthe number of antennas at each node. First, we provide some basic results on\nthe DMT of the general Rayleigh product channels. It turns out that these\nresults have very simple and intuitive interpretation. Then, the results are\napplied to the AF multihop channels which is shown to be equivalent to the\nRayleigh product channel, in the DMT sense. Finally, the project-and-forward\n(PF) scheme, a variant of the AF scheme, is proposed. We show that the PF\nscheme has the same DMT as the AF scheme, while the PF can have significant\npower gain over the AF scheme in some cases. In part II, we will derive the\nupper bound on the diversity of the multihop channels and show that it can be\nachieved by partitioning the multihop channel into AF subchannels.\n",

        "abstract": "  The mean curvature flow describes the parabolic deformation of embedded\nbranes in Riemannian geometry driven by their extrinsic mean curvature vector,\nwhich is typically associated to surface tension forces. It is the gradient\nflow of the area functional, and, as such, it is naturally identified with the\nboundary renormalization group equation of Dirichlet sigma models away from\nconformality, to lowest order in perturbation theory. D-branes appear as fixed\npoints of this flow having conformally invariant boundary conditions. Simple\nrunning solutions include the paper-clip and the hair-pin (or grim-reaper)\nmodels on the plane, as well as scaling solutions associated to rational (p, q)\nclosed curves and the decay of two intersecting lines. Stability analysis is\nperformed in several cases while searching for transitions among different\nbrane configurations. The combination of Ricci with the mean curvature flow is\nexamined in detail together with several explicit examples of deforming curves\non curved backgrounds. Some general aspects of the mean curvature flow in\nhigher dimensional ambient spaces are also discussed and obtain consistent\ntruncations to lower dimensional systems. Selected physical applications are\nmentioned in the text, including tachyon condensation in open string theory and\nthe resistive diffusion of force-free fields in magneto-hydrodynamics.\n",

        "abstract": "  A generalized geometric method is developed for constructing exact solutions\nof gravitational field equations in Einstein theory and generalizations. First,\nwe apply the formalism of nonholonomic frame deformations (formally considered\nfor nonholonomic manifolds and Finsler spaces) when the gravitational field\nequations transform into systems of nonlinear partial differential equations\nwhich can be integrated in general form. The new classes of solutions are\ndefined by generic off-diagonal metrics depending on integration functions on\none, two and three (or three and four) variables if we consider four (or five)\ndimensional spacetimes. Second, we use a general scheme when one (two)\nparameter families of exact solutions are defined by any source-free solutions\nof Einstein's equations with one (two) Killing vector field(s). A successive\niteration procedure results in new classes of solutions characterized by an\ninfinite number of parameters for a non-Abelian group involving arbitrary\nfunctions on one variable. Five classes of exact off-diagonal solutions are\nconstructed in vacuum Einstein and in string gravity describing solitonic\npp-wave interactions. We explore possible physical consequences of such\nsolutions derived from primary Schwarzschild or pp-wave metrics.\n",

In the fundamental case R = Z,\nour result states that the only polynomial cohomology rings over Z which can\noccur, are tensor products of copies of H^*(CP^\\infty;Z) = Z[x_2],\nH^*(BSU(n);Z) = Z[x_4,x_6,...,x_{2n}], and H^*(BSp(n):Z) =\nZ[x_4,x_8,...,x_{4n}] confirming an old conjecture. Our classification extends\nNotbohm's solution for R = F_p, p odd. Odd degree generators, excluded above,\nonly occur if R is an F_2-algebra and in that case the recent classification of\n2-compact groups by the authors can be used instead of the present paper.

        "abstract": "  This paper is dedicated to triangulated categories endowed with weight\nstructures (a new notion; D. Pauksztello has independently introduced them as\nco-t-structures). This axiomatizes the properties of stupid truncations of\ncomplexes in $K(B)$. We also construct weight structures for Voevodsky's\ncategories of motives and for various categories of spectra. A weight structure\n$w$ defines Postnikov towers of objects; these towers are canonical and\nfunctorial 'up to morphisms that are zero on cohomology'. For $Hw$ being the\nheart of $w$ (in $DM_{gm}$ we have $Hw=Chow$) we define a canonical\nconservative 'weakly exact' functor $t$ from our $C$ to a certain weak category\nof complexes $K_w(Hw)$. For any (co)homological functor $H:C\\to A$ for an\nabelian $A$ we construct a weight spectral sequence $T:H(X^i[j])\\implies\nH(X[i+j])$ where $(X^i)=t(X)$; it is canonical and functorial starting from\n$E_2$. This spectral sequences specializes to the 'usual' (Deligne's) weight\nspectral sequences for 'classical' realizations of motives and to\nAtiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequences for spectra. Under certain restrictions,\nwe prove that $K_0(C)\\cong K_0(Hw)$ and $K_0(End C)\\cong K_0(End Hw)$.\n  The definition of a weight structure is almost dual to those of a\nt-structure; yet several properties differ. One can often construct a certain\n$t$-structure which is 'adjacent' to $w$ and vice versa. This is the case for\nthe Voevodsky's $DM^{eff}_-$ (one obtains certain new Chow weight and\nt-structures for it; the heart of the latter is 'dual' to $Chow^{eff}$) and for\nthe stable homotopy category. The Chow t-structure is closely related to\nunramified cohomology.\n",

A fault-tolerant memory architecture based on low-density\nparity-check codes is proposed and the existence of reliable memories for the\nadversarial failure model is proved. The proof relies on the expansion property\nof the underlying Tanner graph of the code. An equivalence between the\nTaylor-Kuznetsov (TK) scheme and Gallager B algorithm is established and the\nresults are extended to the independent failure model. It is also shown that\nthe proposed memory architecture has lower redundancy compared to the TK\nscheme. The results are illustrated with specific numerical examples.\n",

Similarly to the twistor spaces of\n'double solid type' on 3CP^2, projective models of present twistor spaces have\na natural structure of double covering of a CP^2-bundle over CP^1. We\nexplicitly give a defining polynomial of the branch divisor of the double\ncovering whose restriction to fibers are degree four. If n>3 these are new\ntwistor spaces, to the best of the author's knowledge. We also compute the\ndimension of the moduli space of these twistor spaces. Differently from\nmath.DG/0701278, the present investigation is based on analysis of\npluri-(half-)anticanonical systems of the twistor spaces.\n",

The auxiliary sample can be independent of the\nprimary sample, or can be a subset of it. For both cases, we derive bounds when\nthe probability of missing data given the proxy variables is unknown, or known,\nor belongs to a correctly specified parametric family. We find that the\nconditional probability is not ancillary when the two samples are independent.\nFor all cases, we discuss efficient semiparametric estimators. An estimator\nbased on a conditional expectation projection is shown to require milder\nregularity conditions than one based on inverse probability weighting.\n",

Our invariants can extract geometric information\nfrom an arbitrary depth of the derived series of the fundamental group, and can\ndetect torsion which is invisible via signature invariants. Applications\nillustrating these features include the following: (1) There are infinitely\nmany homology equivalent rational 3-spheres which are indistinguishable via\nmultisignatures, eta-invariants, and L2-signatures but have distinct homology\ncobordism types. (2) There is an infinite family of 2-torsion (amphichiral)\nknots, including the figure eight knot, with non-slice iterated Bing doubles;\nas a special case, we give the first proof of the conjecture that the Bing\ndouble of the figure eight knot is not slice. (3) There exist infinitely many\ntorsion elements at any depth of the Cochran-Orr-Teichner filtration of link\nconcordance.\n",

Energy efficiency is analyzed in the worst case scenario where\nthe channel estimate is assumed to be perfect and the error in the estimate is\nconsidered as another source of additive Gaussian noise. It is shown that bit\nenergy requirement grows without bound as the snr goes to zero, and the minimum\nbit energy is achieved at a nonzero snr value below which one should not\noperate. The effect of the block length on both the minimum bit energy and the\nsnr value at which the minimum is achieved is investigated. Flash training\nschemes are analyzed and shown to improve the energy efficiency in the low-snr\nregime. Energy efficiency analysis is also carried out when peak power\nconstraints are imposed on pilot signals.\n",

First, it is assumed that binary phase-shift keying (BPSK)\nmodulation is employed at the transmitter. With this assumption, the training\nperiod, and data and training power allocation are jointly optimized by\nmaximizing an achievable rate expression. Achievable rates and energy-per-bit\nrequirements are computed using the optimal training parameters.

The analysis is conducted in two cases: the coherent\nscenario where the fading is perfectly known at the receiver, and the\nnoncoherent scenario where neither the receiver nor the transmitter knows the\nfading coefficients. For both cases, the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP)\ndetection rule is derived and analytical probability of error expressions are\nobtained. The effect of fading correlation among the receiver antennas is also\nstudied. Simulation results indicate that for sufficiently low duty cycle\nvalues, lower probability of error values with respect to FSK signaling are\nachieved. Equivalently, when compared to FSK modulation, OOFSK with low duty\ncycle requires less energy to achieve the same probability of error, which\nrenders this modulation a more energy efficient transmission technique.\n",

This fact has complex\nconsequences on data analysis algorithms that motivate modifications of them.\nIn fact most of the traditional data analysis tools for regression,\nclassification and clustering have been adapted to functional inputs under the\ngeneral name of functional Data Analysis (FDA). In this paper, we investigate\nthe use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for functional data analysis and we\nfocus on the problem of curves discrimination. SVMs are large margin classifier\ntools based on implicit non linear mappings of the considered data into high\ndimensional spaces thanks to kernels. We show how to define simple kernels that\ntake into account the unctional nature of the data and lead to consistent\nclassification. Experiments conducted on real world data emphasize the benefit\nof taking into account some functional aspects of the problems.\n",

While there is no known polynomial time algorithm for solving it\noptimally there are many good heuristics that all provide additive errors to\noptimal. The additive error in these algorithms usually depends linearly upon\nthe largest encoding letter size.\n  This paper was motivated by the problem of finding optimal codes when the\nencoding alphabet is infinite. Because the largest letter cost is infinite, the\nprevious analyses could give infinite error bounds. We provide a new algorithm\nthat works with infinite encoding alphabets. When restricted to the finite\nalphabet case, our algorithm often provides better error bounds than the best\nprevious ones known.\n",

In Efron, Hastie,\nJohnstone & Tibshirani (2004) it is proved that the least angle regression\nalgorithm, with a small modification, solves the lasso regression problem. Here\nwe give an analogous result for incremental forward stagewise regression,\nshowing that it solves a version of the lasso problem that enforces\nmonotonicity. One consequence of this is as follows: while lasso makes optimal\nprogress in terms of reducing the residual sum-of-squares per unit increase in\n$L_1$-norm of the coefficient $\\beta$, forward stage-wise is optimal per unit\n$L_1$ arc-length traveled along the coefficient path. We also study a condition\nunder which the coefficient paths of the lasso are monotone, and hence the\ndifferent algorithms coincide. Finally, we compare the lasso and forward\nstagewise procedures in a simulation study involving a large number of\ncorrelated predictors.\n",

Our goal is to devise an inversion\nprocedure which has the advantages of localization and multiscale analysis of\nwavelet representations without losing the stability and computability of the\nSVD decompositions. To this end we utilize the construction of localized frames\n(termed \"needlets\") built upon the SVD bases. We consider two different\nsituations: the \"wavelet\" scenario, where the needlets are assumed to behave\nsimilarly to true wavelets, and the \"Jacobi-type\" scenario, where we assume\nthat the properties of the frame truly depend on the SVD basis at hand (hence\non the operator). To illustrate each situation, we apply the estimation\nalgorithm respectively to the deconvolution problem and to the Wicksell\nproblem. In the latter case, where the SVD basis is a Jacobi polynomial basis,\nwe show that our scheme is capable of achieving rates of convergence which are\noptimal in the $L_2$ case, we obtain interesting rates of convergence for other\n$L_p$ norms which are new (to the best of our knowledge) in the literature, and\nwe also give a simulation study showing that the NEED-D estimator outperforms\nother standard algorithms in almost all situations.\n",

We study\nrepresentations of the most degenerate series of the algebra ${\\rm\nso}'_q(r,s)$. The formulas of action of operators of these representations upon\nthe basis corresponding to restriction of representations onto the subalgebra\n${\\rm so}'_q(r)\\times {\\rm so}'_q(s)$ are given. Most of these representations\nare irreducible. Reducible representations appear under some conditions for the\nparameters determining the representations. All irreducible constituents which\nappear in reducible representations of the degenerate series are found. All\n$*$-representations of ${\\rm so}'_q(r,s)$ are separated in the set of\nirreducible representations obtained in the paper.\n",

We\ndefine the notion of nonholonomically constrained system, and characterize\nregularity conditions that guarantee that the dynamics of the system can be\nobtained as a suitable projection of the unconstrained dynamics. It is shown\nthat one can define an almost aff-Poisson bracket on the constraint AV-bundle,\nwhich plays a prominent role in the description of nonholonomic dynamics.\nMoreover, these developments give a general description of nonholonomic systems\nand the unified treatment permits to study nonholonomic systems after or before\nreduction in the same framework. Also, it is not necessary to distinguish\nbetween linear or affine constraints and the methods are valid for explicitly\ntime-dependent systems.\n",

This inverse-free\nalgorithm provides full performance in correcting a certain class of errors,\ngeneric errors, which includes most errors, and can decode codes on algebraic\ncurves without the determination of unknown syndromes. Moreover, we propose\nthree different kinds of architectures that our algorithm can be applied to,\nand we represent the control operation of shift-registers and switches at each\nclock-timing with numerical simulations. We estimate the performance in\ncomparison of the total running time and the numbers of multipliers and\nshift-registers in three architectures with those of the conventional ones for\ncodes on algebraic curves.\n",

Motivated by wavelength assignment for multicasts in optical\nnetworks, we introduce and study $n$-fibre colourings of labelled digraphs.\nThese are colourings of the arcs of $D$ such that at each vertex $v$, and for\neach colour $\\alpha$, $in(v,\\alpha)+out(v,\\alpha)\\leq n$ with $in(v,\\alpha)$\nthe number of arcs coloured $\\alpha$ entering $v$ and $out(v,\\alpha)$ the\nnumber of labels $l$ such that there is at least one arc of label $l$ leaving\n$v$ and coloured with $\\alpha$. The problem is to find the minimum number of\ncolours $\\lambda_n(D)$ such that the $m$-labelled digraph $D$ has an $n$-fibre\ncolouring. In the particular case when $D$ is $1$-labelled, $\\lambda_1(D)$ is\ncalled the directed star arboricity of $D$, and is denoted by $dst(D)$. We\nfirst show that $dst(D)\\leq 2\\Delta^-(D)+1$, and conjecture that if\n$\\Delta^-(D)\\geq 2$, then $dst(D)\\leq 2\\Delta^-(D)$. We also prove that for a\nsubcubic digraph $D$, then $dst(D)\\leq 3$, and that if $\\Delta^+(D),\n\\Delta^-(D)\\leq 2$, then $dst(D)\\leq 4$. Finally, we study\n$\\lambda_n(m,k)=\\max\\{\\lambda_n(D) \\tq D \\mbox{is $m$-labelled} \\et\n\\Delta^-(D)\\leq k\\}$. We show that if $m\\geq n$, then $\\ds\n\\left\\lceil\\frac{m}{n}\\left\\lceil \\frac{k}{n}\\right\\rceil + \\frac{k}{n}\n\\right\\rceil\\leq \\lambda_n(m,k) \\leq\\left\\lceil\\frac{m}{n}\\left\\lceil\n\\frac{k}{n}\\right\\rceil + \\frac{k}{n} \\right\\rceil + C \\frac{m^2\\log k}{n}$ for\nsome constant $C$.

In this paper we propose\na new variation of the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm, named Reinforced BP\nalgorithm, that turns BP into a solver. Our simulations show that this new\nalgorithm has complexity O(n log n). Using this new algorithm together with a\nnon-linear coding scheme, we can efficiently achieve rates close to the border\nof the capacity region of the Blackwell channel.\n",

One of these\nis an extension, which we develop here for a non-semisimple generalisation of\nthe Verlinde formula introduced by Fuchs et al., to include fusion products\nwith indecomposable representations. The other uses the Verlinde formula in its\nusual form and gets the fusion coefficients in the limit, in which the basis of\ntorus amplitudes degenerates to the linear dependent set of characters of\nirreducible and indecomposable representations. We discuss the effects, which\nthis linear dependence has on any result for fusion rules, which are calculated\nfrom these character's modular transformation properties. We show that the two\npresented methods are equivalent. Furthermore we calculate explicit BPZ-like\nexpressions for the resulting fusion rules for all p larger than 2.\n",

If X is a reduced Stein space and Z is a stratified\nholomorphic fiber bundle over X all of whose fibers satisfy CAP, then sections\nof Z over X enjoy the Oka property with (jet) interpolation and approximation.\nPreviously this has been proved by the author in the case when X is a Stein\nmanifold without singularities (Ann.

We show that\nfor every p > 1, and every set E of the torus T = R/Z with |E| > 0, there are\nidempotents concentrated on E in the Lp sense. More precisely, for each p > 1,\nthere is an explicitly calculated constant Cp > 0 so that for each E with |E| >\n0 and epsilon > 0 one can find an idempotent f such that the pth root of the\nratio of the integral over E of the pth power of |f| to the integral over T of\nthe pth power of |f| is greater than Cp - epsilon. This is in fact a lower\nbound result and, though not optimal, it is close to the best that our method\ngives.

We also establish a canonical\nbijection between Lagrangian subcategories of the representation category of a\ntwisted quantum double of a finite group G and module categories over the\ncategory of twisted G-graded vector spaces such that the dual tensor category\nis pointed. This can be viewed as a quantum version of V. Drinfeld's\ncharacterization of homogeneous spaces of a Poisson-Lie group in terms of\nLagrangian subalgebras of the double of its Lie bialgebra.

We also show\nthat $DY_{q}^{\\infty}(sl_{2})$-modules are what we call\n$V_{q}$-modules-at-infinity. To achieve this goal, we study what we call\n$\\S$-local subsets and quasi-local subsets of $\\Hom (W,W((x^{-1})))$ for any\nvector space $W$, and we prove that any $\\S$-local subset generates a (weak)\nquantum vertex algebra and that any quasi-local subset generates a vertex\nalgebra with $W$ as a (left) quasi module-at-infinity. Using this result we\nassociate the Lie algebra of pseudo-differential operators on the circle with\nvertex algebras in terms of quasi modules-at-infinity.\n",

In\nthis paper we study geometry of compact Lagrangian submanifolds in complex\nhyperquadrics from the viewpoint of the theory of isoparametric hypersurfaces\nin spheres. From this viewpoint we provide a classification theorem of compact\nhomogeneous Lagrangian submanifolds in complex hyperquadrics by using the\nmoment map technique. Moreover we determine the Hamiltonian stability of\ncompact minimal Lagrangian submanifolds embedded in complex hyperquadrics which\nare obtained as Gauss images of isoparametric hypersurfaces in spheres with\n$g(=1,2,3)$ distinct principal curvatures.\n",

        "abstract": "  This is a sequel to [Ca01]=math.AG/0110051. We define the bimeromorphic {\\it\ncategory} of geometric orbifolds. These interpolate between (compact K\\\" ahler)\nmanifolds and such manifolds with logarithmic structure. These geometric\norbifolds are considered from the point of view of their geometry, and thus\nequipped with the usual invariants of varieties: morphisms and bimeromorphic\nmaps, differential forms, fundamental groups and universal covers, fields of\ndefinition and rational points. The most elementary properties, directly\nadapted from the case of varieties without orbifold structure, are established\nhere. The arguments of [Ca01] can then be directly adapted to extend the main\nstructure results to this orbifold category. We hope to come back to deeper\naspects later. The motivation is that the natural frame for the theory of\nclassification of compact K\\\" ahler (and complex projective) manifolds includes\nat least the category of orbifolds, as shown in [Ca01] by the fonctorial\ndecomposition of {\\it special} manifolds as tower of orbifolds with either\n$\\kappa_+=-\\infty$ or $\\kappa=0$, and also, seemingly, by the minimal model\nprogram, in which most proofs work only after the adjunction of a \"boundary\".\n  Also, fibrations enjoy in the bimeromorphic category of geometric orbifolds\nextension properties not satisfied in the category of varieties without\norbifold structure, permitting to express invariants of the total space from\nthose of the generic fibre and of the base. For example, the natural sequence\nof fundamental groups is exact there; also the total space is special if so are\nthe generic fibre and the base. This makes this category suitable to lift\nproperties from orbifolds having either $\\kappa_+=-\\infty$ or $\\kappa=0$ to\nthose which are special.\n",

While it has been successfully\nemployed in a wide variety of applications, there are relatively few\ntheoretical guarantees of convergence and correctness for general loopy graphs\nthat may have many short cycles. Of these, even fewer provide exact ``necessary\nand sufficient'' characterizations.\n  In this paper we investigate the problem of using max-product to find the\nmaximum weight matching in an arbitrary graph with edge weights. This is done\nby first constructing a probability distribution whose mode corresponds to the\noptimal matching, and then running max-product. Weighted matching can also be\nposed as an integer program, for which there is an LP relaxation. This\nrelaxation is not always tight. In this paper we show that \\begin{enumerate}\n\\item If the LP relaxation is tight, then max-product always converges, and\nthat too to the correct answer. \\item If the LP relaxation is loose, then\nmax-product does not converge. \\end{enumerate} This provides an exact,\ndata-dependent characterization of max-product performance, and a precise\nconnection to LP relaxation, which is a well-studied optimization technique.\nAlso, since LP relaxation is known to be tight for bipartite graphs, our\nresults generalize other recent results on using max-product to find weighted\nmatchings in bipartite graphs.\n",

The case considered is that in\nwhich each user is allowed to vary its transmit power, spreading code, and\nuplink receiver in order to maximize its own utility, which is here defined as\nthe ratio of data throughput to transmit power. In particular, the case in\nwhich linear multiuser detectors are employed at the receiver is treated first,\nand, then, the more challenging case in which non-linear decision feedback\nmultiuser receivers are adopted is addressed. It is shown that, for both\nreceivers, the problem at hand of utility maximization can be regarded as a\nnon-cooperative game, and it is proved that a unique Nash equilibrium point\nexists. Simulation results show that significant performance gains can be\nobtained through both non-linear processing and spreading code optimization; in\nparticular, for systems with a number of users not larger than the processing\ngain, remarkable gains come from spreading code optimization, while, for\noverloaded systems, the largest gainscome from the use of non-linear\nprocessing. In every case, however, the non-cooperative games proposed here are\nshown to outperform competing alternatives.\n",

We show that the model can\nbe naturally described in terms of the mathematical theory of ``Chiral\nDifferential Operators\". In particular, the physical anomalies of the sigma\nmodel can be reinterpreted as an obstruction to a global definition of the\nassociated sheaf of vertex superalgebras derived from the free conformal field\ntheory describing the model locally on $X$. In addition, one can also obtain a\nnovel understanding of the sigma model one-loop beta function solely in terms\nof holomorphic data. At the $(2,2)$ locus, one can describe the resulting\nhalf-twisted variant of the topological B-model in terms of a $\\it{mirror}$\n\"Chiral de Rham complex\" (or CDR) defined by Malikov et al. in \\cite{GMS1}. Via\nmirror symmetry, one can also derive various conjectural expressions relating\nthe sheaf cohomology of the mirror CDR to that of the original CDR on pairs of\nCalabi-Yau mirror manifolds. An analysis of the half-twisted model on a\nnon-K\\\"ahler group manifold with torsion also allows one to draw conclusions\nabout the corresponding sheaves of CDR (and its mirror) that are consistent\nwith mathematically established results by Ben-Bassat in \\cite{ben} on the\nmirror symmetry of generalised complex manifolds. These conclusions therefore\nsuggest an interesting relevance of the sheaf of CDR in the recent study of\ngeneralised mirror symmetry.\n",

A series of recent results seems to indicate that it will\nbe nearly impossible to characterize explicitly the sets of all Gorenstein or\nof all level Hilbert functions. Therefore, our conjectures would at least\nprovide the existence of a very strong - and natural - form of order in the\nstructure of such important and complicated sets.\n  We are still far from proving the conjectures at this point. However, we will\nalready solve a few interesting cases, especially when it comes to the IC, in\nthis paper. Among them, that of Gorenstein $h$-vectors of socle degree 4, that\nof level $h$-vectors of socle degree 2, and that of non-unimodal level\n$h$-vectors of socle degree 3 and any given codimension.\n",

        "abstract": "  Random walks on expander graphs were thoroughly studied, with the important\nmotivation that, under some natural conditions, these walks mix quickly and\nprovide an efficient method of sampling the vertices of a graph. Alon,\nBenjamini, Lubetzky and Sodin studied non-backtracking random walks on regular\ngraphs, and showed that their mixing rate may be up to twice as fast as that of\nthe simple random walk. As an application, they showed that the maximal number\nof visits to a vertex, made by a non-backtracking random walk of length $n$ on\na high-girth $n$-vertex regular expander, is typically $(1+o(1))\\frac{\\log\nn}{\\log\\log n}$, as in the case of the balls and bins experiment. They further\nasked whether one can establish the precise distribution of the visits such a\nwalk makes.\n  In this work, we answer the above question by combining a generalized form of\nBrun's sieve with some extensions of the ideas in Alon et al. Let $N_t$ denote\nthe number of vertices visited precisely $t$ times by a non-backtracking random\nwalk of length $n$ on a regular $n$-vertex expander of fixed degree and girth\n$g$. We prove that if $g=\\omega(1)$, then for any fixed $t$, $N_t/n$ is\ntypically $\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{e}t!}+o(1)$. Furthermore, if $g=\\Omega(\\log\\log\nn)$, then $N_t/n$ is typically $\\frac{1+o(1)}{\\mathrm{e}t!}$ uniformly on all\n$t \\leq (1-o(1))\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log n}$ and 0 for all $t \\geq\n(1+o(1))\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log n}$. In particular, we obtain the above result\non the typical maximal number of visits to a single vertex, with an improved\nthreshold window. The essence of the proof lies in showing that variables\ncounting the number of visits to a set of sufficiently distant vertices are\nasymptotically independent Poisson variables.\n",

Focusing on energy\nefficiency, a noncooperative game is proposed in which users in the network are\nallowed to choose their transmit powers to maximize their own utilities, and\nthe Nash equilibrium for the proposed game is derived. It is shown that, due to\nthe frequency selective multipath, the noncooperative solution is achieved at\ndifferent signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios, respectively of the channel\nrealization. A large-system analysis is performed to derive explicit\nexpressions for the achieved utilities.

Three different forms of the problem are considered. The\nfirst is a variable-rate setup, in which the decoder adaptively chooses the\nrates at which the sensors transmit. An explicit characterization of the\nvariable-rate minimum achievable sum rate is stated, given by the maximum\nentropy over the set of distributions indistinguishable from the true source\ndistribution by the decoder. In addition, two forms of the fixed-rate problem\nare considered, one with deterministic coding and one with randomized coding.\nThe achievable rate regions are given for both these problems, with a larger\nregion achievable using randomized coding, though both are suboptimal compared\nto variable-rate coding.\n",

SCR is studied in the context\nof the stable set problem in a graph, and we show that many of the well-known\nfacet normals of the stable set polytope appear in at most two rounds of our\nprocedure. Our results reveal a uniform hypercyclic structure behind the\nnormals of many complicated facet inequalities in the literature for the stable\nset polytope. Lower bounds for SCR are derived both in general and for\npolytopes in the unit cube.\n",

We functorially relate this category to the category of\nholomorphic vector bundles on noncommutative tori as introduced by Polishchuk\nand Schwarz and study the induced map between the corresponding K-theories. In\naddition, there is a forgetful functor to the category of noncommutative\nelliptic curves of Soibelman and Vologodsky, as well as a forgetful functor to\nthe category of vector bundles on $\\mathbb{C}^*$ with regular singular\nconnections.\n  The category that we consider has the nice property of being a Tannakian\ncategory, hence it is equivalent to the category of representations of an\naffine group scheme. Via an equivariant version of the Riemann-Hilbert\ncorrespondence we determine this group scheme to be (the algebraic hull of)\n$\\mathbb{Z}^2$. We also obtain a full subcategory of the category of\nholomorphic bundles of the noncommutative torus, which is equivalent to the\ncategory of representations of $\\mathbb{Z}$. This group is the proposed\ntopological fundamental group of the noncommutative torus (understood as a\ndegenerate elliptic curve) and we study Nori's notion of \\'etale fundamental\ngroup in this context.\n",

Counting arguments and insights from the phase-space\nSchmidt decomposition and in general from the framework of symplectic analysis,\naccompany our description of the standard form of pure n-mode Gaussian states.\nIn particular we clarify why only in pure states with n<=3 modes all the direct\ncorrelations between position and momentum operators can be set to zero by\nlocal unitary operations. For any n, the emerging minimal set of parametres\ncontains complete information about all forms of entanglement in the\ncorresponding states. An efficient state engineering scheme (able to encode\ndirect correlations between position and momentum operators as well) is\nproposed to produce entangled multimode Gaussian resources, its number of\noptical elements matching the minimal number of locally invariant degrees of\nfreedom of general pure n-mode Gaussian states. We demonstrate that so-called\n\"block-diagonal\" Gaussian states, without direct correlations between position\nand momentum, are systematically less entangled, on average, than arbitrary\npure Gaussian states.\n",

The principal result is the\nreducibility criterion for the Verma modules of T(g) for a wide class of Lie\nalgebras g, including the symmetrizable Kac-Moody Lie algebras, the Heisenberg\nalgebra, and the Virasoro algebra.

The detection of the co-jumps\nallows to gain insight in the dependence structure of the jump components and\nhas important applications in finance. Our estimators are based on a threshold\nprinciple allowing to isolate the jumps. This work follows Gobbi and Mancini\n(2006) where the asymptotic normality for the estimator of the covariation,\nwith convergence speed given by the squared root of h, was obtained when the\njump components have finite activity. Here we show that the speed is the\nsquared root of h only when the activity of the jump components is moderate.\n",

HRMSMs\nallow investigators to analyze the causal effect of a treatment on an outcome\nbased on a fixed, shorter and user-specified history of exposure compared to\nMSMs. By default, the latter represent the treatment causal effect of interest\nbased on a treatment history defined by the treatments assigned between the\nstudy's start and outcome collection. We lay out in this article the formal\nstatistical framework behind HRMSMs. Beyond allowing a more flexible causal\nanalysis, HRMSMs improve computational tractability and mitigate statistical\npower concerns when designing longitudinal studies. We also develop three\nconsistent estimators of HRMSM parameters under sufficient model assumptions:\nthe Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighted (IPTW), G-computation and Double\nRobust (DR) estimators. In addition, we show that the assumptions commonly\nadopted for identification and consistent estimation of MSM parameters\n(existence of counterfactuals, consistency, time-ordering and sequential\nrandomization assumptions) also lead to identification and consistent\nestimation of HRMSM parameters.\n",

Our\nvaluation formula satisfies a number of desirable properties, many of which it\nshares with the standard deviation premium principle. The major result of the\npaper is that the price per contract solves a linear partial differential\nequation as the number of contracts approaches infinity. One can interpret the\nlimiting price as an expectation with respect to an equivalent martingale\nmeasure. Another important result is that if the hazard rate is stochastic,\nthen the risk-adjusted premium is greater than the net premium, even as the\nnumber of contracts approaches infinity. We present a numerical example to\nillustrate our results, along with the corresponding algorithms.\n",

We do this by assuming that the company issuing a\nmortality-contingent claim requires compensation for this risk in the form of a\npre-specified instantaneous Sharpe ratio. We prove that our ensuing valuation\nformula satisfies a number of desirable properties. For example, we show that\nit is subadditive in the number of contracts sold. A key result is that if the\nhazard rate is stochastic, then the risk-adjusted survival probability is\ngreater than the physical survival probability, even as the number of contracts\napproaches infinity.\n",

It is shown that for\nspecific values of the variables x=(x_1,x_2,...,x_p) there is a hidden duality\nbetween n and x. Analytic continuation allows us to construct another\ncommutative algebra A_n in the variables n=(n_1,n_2,...,n_p) which is also\ndiagonalized by R_p(n;x). Thus R_p(n;x) solve a multivariable discrete\nbispectral problem in the sense of Duistermaat and Grunbaum [8]. Since a change\nof the variables and the parameters in the Racah polynomials gives the\nmultivariable Wilson polynomials [26], this change of variables and parameters\nin A_x and A_n leads to bispectral commutative algebras for the multivariable\nWilson polynomials.\n",

The absence\nof an edge between any pair of vertices (or variables) is equivalent to full\nconditional independence between these two variables given all the other\nvariables. In the multivariate Gaussian case, the absence of an edge\ncorresponds to a zero coefficient in the precision matrix, which is the inverse\nof the covariance matrix. It is well known that this concentration graph\nrepresents some of the conditional independencies in the distribution of the\nassociated random vector. These conditional independencies correspond to the\n\"separations\" or absence of edges in that graph. In this paper we assume that\nthere are no other independencies present in the probability distribution than\nthose represented by the graph. This property is called the perfect\nMarkovianity of the probability distribution with respect to the associated\nconcentration graph. We prove in this paper that this particular concentration\ngraph, the one associated with a perfect Markov distribution, can be determined\nby only conditioning on a limited number of variables. We demonstrate that this\nnumber is equal to the maximum size of the minimal separators in the\nconcentration graph.\n",

We introduce a class of $\\mathbbZ_2$-graded\ncommutative but not associative algebras that we call ``Lie antialgebras''.\nThese algebras are closely related to Lie (super)algebras and, in some sense,\nlink together commutative and Lie algebras. The main notions we define in this\npaper are: representations of Lie antialgebras, an analog of the Lie-Poisson\nbivector (which is not Poisson) and central extensions. We also classify simple\nfinite-dimensional Lie antialgebras.\n",

We give a precise relation between the dimer model on a graph embedded\non a torus and the massless free Majorana fermion living on the same lattice. A\nloop expansion of the fermion determinant is performed, where the loops turn\nout to be compositions of two perfect matchings. These loop states are sorted\ninto co-chain groups using categorification techniques similar to the ones used\nfor categorifying knot polynomials. The Euler characteristic of the resulting\nco-chain complex recovers the Newton polynomial of the dimer model. We\nre-interpret this system as supersymmetric quantum mechanics, where\nconfigurations with vanishing net winding number form the ground states.\nFinally, we make use of the quiver gauge theory - dimer model correspondence to\nobtain an interpretation of the loops in terms of the physics of D-branes\nprobing a toric Calabi-Yau singularity.\n",

We\nextend our analytic results for sub-elliptic boundary value problems for the\nSpinC-Dirac operator, and gluing results for the indices of these boundary\nproblems to SpinC-manifolds with several pseudoconvex (pseudoconcave) boundary\ncomponents. These results are applied to study Stein fillability for compact,\n3-dimensional, contact manifolds.\n",

There are a number of alternate characterizations:\nthe operator of multiplication by $S$ defines a contraction operator between\ntwo Hardy Hilbert spaces, $S$ satisfies a von Neumann inequality, a certain\noperator-valued kernel associated with $S$ is positive-definite, and $S$ can be\nrealized as the transfer function of a dissipative (or even conservative)\ndiscrete-time linear input/state/output linear system. Various multivariable\ngeneralizations of this class have appeared recently,one of the most\nencompassing being that of Muhly and Solel where the unit disk is replaced by\nthe strict unit ball of the elements of a dual correspondence $E^{\\sigma}$\nassociated with a $W^{*}$-correspondence $E$ over a $W^{*}$-algebra $\\cA$\ntogether with a $*$-representation $\\sigma$ of $\\cA$. The main new point which\nwe add here is the introduction of the notion of reproducing kernel Hilbert\ncorrespondence and identification of the Muhly-Solel Hardy spaces as\nreproducing kernel Hilbert correspondences associated with a completely\npositive analogue of the classical Szeg\\\"o kernel. In this way we are able to\nmake the analogy between the Muhly-Solel Schur class and the classical Schur\nclass more complete. We also illustrate the theory by specializing it to some\nwell-studied special cases; in some instances there result new kinds of\nrealization theorems.\n",

We review this observation in the context of\na one parameter family of quintic threefolds, and study the zeta-function as a\nfunction of the parameter \\phi. Owing to cancellations, the superdeterminant of\nan infinite matrix reduces to the (ordinary) determinant of a finite matrix,\nU(\\phi), corresponding to the action of the Frobenius map on certain cohomology\ngroups. The parameter-dependence of U(\\phi) is given by a relation\nU(\\phi)=E^{-1}(\\phi^p)U(0)E(\\phi) with E(\\phi) a Wronskian matrix formed from\nthe periods of the manifold. The periods are defined by series that converge\nfor $|\\phi|_p < 1$. The values of \\phi that are of interest are those for which\n\\phi^p = \\phi so, for nonzero \\phi, we have |\\vph|_p=1. We explain how the\nprocess of p-adic analytic continuation applies to this case. The matrix\nU(\\phi) breaks up into submatrices of rank 4 and rank 2 and we are able from\nthis perspective to explain some of the observations that have been made\npreviously by numerical calculation.\n",

        "abstract": "  This paper and its prequel (\"Part I\") prove a generalization of the usual\ngluing theorem for two index 1 pseudoholomorphic curves U_+ and U_- in the\nsymplectization of a contact 3-manifold. We assume that for each embedded Reeb\norbit gamma, the total multiplicity of the negative ends of U_+ at covers of\ngamma agrees with the total multiplicity of the positive ends of U_- at covers\nof gamma. However, unlike in the usual gluing story, here the individual\nmultiplicities are allowed to differ. In this situation, one can often glue U_+\nand U_- to an index 2 curve by inserting genus zero branched covers of\nR-invariant cylinders between them. This paper shows that the signed count of\nsuch gluings equals a signed count of zeroes of a certain section of an\nobstruction bundle over the moduli space of branched covers of the cylinder.\nPart I obtained a combinatorial formula for the latter count and, assuming the\nresult of the present paper, deduced that the differential d in embedded\ncontact homology satisfies d^2=0. The present paper completes all of the\nanalysis that was needed in Part I. The gluing technique explained here is in\nprinciple applicable to more gluing problems. We also prove some lemmas\nconcerning the generic behavior of pseudoholomorphic curves in\nsymplectizations, which may be of independent interest.\n",

Motivated by the recent results for compact manifolds we construct\nKempf's distortion function and derive a precise TYZ asymptotic expansion for\nthe Kepler manifold. We get an exact formula: finite asymptotic expansion of\n$n-1$ terms and exponentially small error terms uniformly with respect to the\ndiscrete quantization parameter $m\\to \\infty $ and $\\rho \\to \\infty$, $\\rho$\nbeing the polar radius in $\\C^n$.\n  Moreover, the coefficents are calculated explicitly and they turned out to be\nhomogeneous functions with respect to the polar radius in the Kepler manifold.\nWe also prove and derive an asymptotic expansion of the obtstruction term with\nthe coefficients being defined by geometrical quantities. We show that our\nestimates are sharp by analyzing the nonharmonic behaviour of $T_m$ and the\nerror term of the approximation of the Fubini--Study metric by $m\\omega$ for\n$m\\to +\\infty$. The arguments of the proofs combine geometrical methods,\nquantization tools and functional analytic techniques for investigating\nasymptotic expansions in the framework of analytic-Gevrey spaces.\n",

The\nidea of this construction is similar to the pure spinor formalism developed by\nN.Berkovits. It is demonstrated that using this formalism it is possible to\nprove that the certain Chern-Simons-like (Witten's OSFT-like) theory can be\nconsidered as an off-shell version for some on-shell supersymmetric field\ntheories. We use the simplest non-trivial model found in [2] to illustrate the\npower of this pure spinor superfield formalism. Then we redo all the\ncalculations for the case of 10-dimensional Super-Yang-Mills theory. The\nconstruction of off-shell description for this theory is more subtle in\ncomparison with the model of [2] and requires additional Z_2 projection. We\ndiscover experimentally (through a direct explicit calculation) a non-trivial\nZ_2 duality at the level of Feynman diagrams. The nature of this duality\nrequires a better investigation.\n",

Both simplifications can be\nimplemented using the coarse projective integration framework. The resulting\nparticle filter is faster and has smaller variance than the particle filter\nbased on the original system.

This is done by proving first\nthat for each integer n, there is a local sentence phi_n which has well ordered\nmodels of order type alpha, for every infinite ordinal alpha > omega which is\nnot an n-Mahlo cardinal.\n",

Uniqueness shall\nprove important for developing algorithms to determine the Taylor coefficients\nof the terms appearing in these representations.

The argument is developed\nthrough the study of the extremals of action functionals defined on piecewise\ndifferentiable curves, in the presence of differentiable non-holonomic\nconstraints. Special emphasis is put on the tensorial aspects of the theory. To\nstart with, the kinematical foundations, culminating in the so called\nvariational equation, are put on geometrical grounds, via the introduction of\nthe concept of infinitesimal control . On the same basis, the usual\nclassification of the extremals of a variational problem into normal and\nabnormal ones is also rationalized, showing the existence of a purely\nkinematical algorithm assigning to each admissible curve a corresponding\nabnormality index, defined in terms of a suitable linear map. The whole\nmachinery is then applied to constrained variational calculus. The argument\nprovides an interesting revisitation of Pontryagin maximum principle and of the\nErdmann-Weierstrass corner conditions, as well as a proof of the classical\nLagrange multipliers method and a local interpretation of Pontryagin's\nequations as dynamical equations for a free (singular) Hamiltonian system. As a\nfinal, highly non-trivial topic, a sufficient condition for the existence of\nfinite deformations with fixed endpoints is explicitly stated and proved.\n",

As a consequence, we confirm the 1993 Bershadsky-Cecotti\nOoguri-Vafa (BCOV) prediction for the standard genus 1 GW-invariants of a\nquintic threefold. We combine constructions from a series of previous papers\nwith the classical localization theorem to relate the reduced genus 1\ninvariants of a CY-hypersurface to previously computed integrals on moduli\nspaces of stable genus 0 maps into projective space. The resulting, rather\nunwieldy, expressions for a genus 1 equivariant generating function simplify\ndrastically, using a regularity property of a genus 0 equivariant generating\nfunction in half of the cases. Finally, by disregarding terms that cannot\neffect the non-equivariant part of the former, we relate the answer to an\nexplicit hypergeometric series in a simple way. The approach described in this\npaper is systematic. It is directly applicable to computing reduced genus 1\nGW-invariants of other complete intersections and should apply to higher-genus\nlocalization computations.\n",

The category\nof exploded fibrations is an extension of the smooth category in which some of\nthese degenerations can be described as smooth families.\n  The first part of this paper is devoted to defining exploded fibrations and a\nslightly more specialized category of exploded torus fibrations. Later sections\ncontain the transverse interesction theory for exploded fibrations and some\nexamples of holomorphic curves in exploded torus fibrations, including a brief\ndiscussion of the relationship between tropical geometry and exploded torus\nfibrations. In the final section, the perturbation theory of holomorphic curves\nin exploded torus fibrations is sketched.\n",

        "abstract": "  We prove that the packing dimension of any mean porous Radon measure on\n$\\mathbb R^d$ may be estimated from above by a function which depends on mean\nporosity. The upper bound tends to $d-1$ as mean porosity tends to its maximum\nvalue. This result was stated in \\cite{BS}, and in a weaker form in \\cite{JJ1},\nbut the proofs are not correct. Quite surprisingly, it turns out that mean\nporous measures are not necessarily approximable by mean porous sets. We verify\nthis by constructing an example of a mean porous measure $\\mu$ on $\\mathbb R$\nsuch that $\\mu(A)=0$ for all mean porous sets $A\\subset\\mathbb R$.\n",

This also provides a description of vector-valued modular forms of\narbitrary half-integer weight. It is shown that the space of these modular\nfunctions is spanned, as a module over the polynomials in J, by the columns of\na matrix that satisfies an abstract hypergeometric equation, providing a simple\nsolution of the Riemann-Hilbert problem for representations of the modular\ngroup. Restrictions on the coefficients of this differential equation implied\nby analyticity are discussed, and an inversion formula is presented that allows\nthe determination of an arbitrary vector-valued modular function from its\nsingular behavior. Questions of rationality and positivity of expansion\ncoefficients are addressed. Closed expressions for the number of vector-valued\nmodular forms of half-integer weight are given, and the general theory is\nillustrated on simple examples.\n",

Our experience with the\nGaudin models associated to finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras suggests\nthat the common eigenvalues of the mutually commuting quantum Hamiltonians in a\nmodel associated to an affine algebra should be encoded by affine opers\nassociated to the Langlands dual affine algebra. This leads us to some concrete\npredictions for the spectra of the quantum Hamiltonians of the soliton systems.\nIn particular, for the KdV system the corresponding affine opers may be\nexpressed as Schroedinger operators with spectral parameter, and our\npredictions in this case match those recently made by Bazhanov, Lukyanov and\nZamolodchikov. This suggests that this and other recently found examples of the\ncorrespondence between quantum integrals of motion and differential operators\nmay be viewed as special cases of the Langlands duality.\n",

        "abstract": "  We present a mathematically justifiable, computationally simple, sample\neigenvalue based procedure for estimating the number of high-dimensional\nsignals in white noise using relatively few samples. The main motivation for\nconsidering a sample eigenvalue based scheme is the computational simplicity\nand the robustness to eigenvector modelling errors which are can adversely\nimpact the performance of estimators that exploit information in the sample\neigenvectors.\n  There is, however, a price we pay by discarding the information in the sample\neigenvectors; we highlight a fundamental asymptotic limit of sample eigenvalue\nbased detection of weak/closely spaced high-dimensional signals from a limited\nsample size. This motivates our heuristic definition of the effective number of\nidentifiable signals which is equal to the number of \"signal\" eigenvalues of\nthe population covariance matrix which exceed the noise variance by a factor\nstrictly greater than 1+sqrt(Dimensionality of the system/Sample size). The\nfundamental asymptotic limit brings into sharp focus why, when there are too\nfew samples available so that the effective number of signals is less than the\nactual number of signals, underestimation of the model order is unavoidable (in\nan asymptotic sense) when using any sample eigenvalue based detection scheme,\nincluding the one proposed herein. The analysis reveals why adding more sensors\ncan only exacerbate the situation. Numerical simulations are used to\ndemonstrate that the proposed estimator consistently estimates the true number\nof signals in the dimension fixed, large sample size limit and the effective\nnumber of identifiable signals in the large dimension, large sample size limit.\n",

The main result is a long exact\nsequence that relates the higher homotopy groups of the space $\\Hom_*(G,H)$\nwith the homotopy groups of $\\Hom_*(G,H^I)$. Here $\\Hom_*(G,H)$ is a space\nwhich parametrizes pointed graph maps from $G$ to $H$ (a pointed version of the\nusual $\\Hom$ complex), and $H^I$ is the graph of based paths in $H$. As a\ncorollary it is shown that $\\pi_i \\big(\\Hom_*(G,H) \\big) \\cong [G,\\Omega^i\nH]_{\\times}$, where $\\Omega H$ is the graph of based closed paths in $H$ and\n$[G,K]_{\\times}$ is the set of $\\times$-homotopy classes of pointed graph maps\nfrom $G$ to $K$. This is similar in spirit to the results of \\cite{BBLL}, where\nthe authors seek a space whose homotopy groups encode a similarly defined\nhomotopy theory for graphs.

        "abstract": "  In the matrix product states approach to $n$ species diffusion processes the\nstationary probability distribution is expressed as a matrix product state with\nrespect to a quadratic algebra determined by the dynamics of the process. The\nquadratic algebra defines a noncommutative space with a $SU_q(n)$ quantum group\naction as its symmetry. Boundary processes amount to the appearance of\nparameter dependent linear terms in the algebraic relations and lead to a\nreduction of the $SU_q(n)$ symmetry. We argue that the boundary operators of\nthe asymmetric simple exclusion process generate a tridiagonal algebra whose\nirriducible representations are expressed in terms of the Askey-Wilson\npolynomials. The Askey-Wilson algebra arises as a symmetry of the boundary\nproblem and allows to solve the model exactly.\n",

The main result of this note is that\nthe nilpotent bicone is a complete intersection. This affirmatively answers a\nconjecture of Kraft-Wallach concerning the nullcone. In addition, we introduce\nand study the characteristic submodule of g. The properties of the nilpotent\nbicone and the characteristic submodule are known to be very important for the\nunderstanding of the commuting variety and its ideal of definition. In order to\nstudy the nilpotent bicone, we introduce another subvariety, the principal\nbicone. The nilpotent bicone, as well as the principal bicone, are linked to\njet schemes. We study their dimensions using arguments from motivic\nintegration. Namely, we follow methods developed in\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/math/0008002v5 .\n",

We refer to this phenomenon as duration-driven long\nrange dependence (DDLRD), as opposed to the more widely studied linear long\nrange dependence based on fractional differencing of an $iid$ process. We\nconsider in detail two specific processes having DDLRD, originally presented in\nTaqqu and Levy (1986), and Parke (1999). For these processes, we obtain the\nlimiting distribution of suitably standardized discrete Fourier transforms\n(DFTs) and sample autocovariances. At low frequencies, the standardized DFTs\nconverge to a stable law, as do the standardized sample autocovariances at\nfixed lags. Finite collections of standardized sample autocovariances at a\nfixed set of lags converge to a degenerate distribution. The standardized DFTs\nat high frequencies converge to a Gaussian law. Our asymptotic results are\nstrikingly similar for the two DDLRD processes studied. We calibrate our\nasymptotic results with a simulation study which also investigates the\nproperties of the semiparametric log periodogram regression estimator of the\nmemory parameter.\n",

Here the\nfirst (n-1) standard generators of the group act by (-q)-multiplication, while\nthe last one acts by (-t)-multiplication. The proof uses some technical results\nfrom previous papers plus computations over a suitable spectral sequence. The\nremaining cases follow from an application of Shapiro's lemma, by considering\nsome well-known inclusions: we obtain the rational cohomology of the Artin\ngroup of affine type \\tilde{A}_{n} as well as the cohomology of the classical\nbraid group {Br}_{n} with coefficients in the n-dimensional representation\npresented in \\cite{tong}. The topological counterpart is the explicit\nconstruction of finite CW-complexes endowed with a free action of the Artin\ngroups, which are known to be K(\\pi,1) spaces in some cases (including finite\ntype groups). Particularly simple formulas for the Euler-characteristic of\nthese orbit spaces are derived.\n",

        "abstract": "  We demonstrate that the transfer matrix of the inhomogeneous $N$-state chiral\nPotts model with two vertical superintegrable rapidities serves as the\n$Q$-operator of XXZ chain model for a cyclic representation of $U_{\\sf\nq}(sl_2)$ with $N$th root-of-unity ${\\sf q}$ and representation-parameter for\nodd $N$. The symmetry problem of XXZ chain with a general cyclic $U_{\\sf\nq}(sl_2)$-representation is mapped onto the problem of studying $Q$-operator of\nsome special one-parameter family of generalized $\\tau^{(2)}$-models. In\nparticular, the spin-$\\frac{N-1}{2}$ XXZ chain model with ${\\sf q}^N=1$ and the\nhomogeneous $N$-state chiral Potts model at a specific superintegrable point\nare unified as one physical theory. By Baxter's method developed for producing\n$Q_{72}$-operator of the root-of-unity eight-vertex model, we construct the\n$Q_R, Q_L$- and $Q$-operators of a superintegrable $\\tau^{(2)}$-model, then\nidentify them with transfer matrices of the $N$-state chiral Potts model for a\npositive integer $N$. We thus obtain a new method of producing the\nsuperintegrable $N$-state chiral Potts transfer matrix from the\n$\\tau^{(2)}$-model by constructing its $Q$-operator.\n",

These spaces are obtained by adding to the classical\nTeichmuller space TS the points corresponding to nodal Riemann surfaces. Unlike\nTS, the space ATS is not a complex manifold (it is not even locally compact).\nWe prove however that the quotient of ATS by any finite index subgroup of the\nTeichmuller modular group has a canonical structure of a complex orbifold.\nUsing this structure we construct natural maps from ATS to stacks of admissible\ncoverings of stable Riemann surfaces. This result is important for\nunderstanding the cup-product in stringy orbifold cohomology. We also establish\nsome new technical results from the general theory of orbifolds which may be of\nindependent interest.\n",

The proposed generalization of the Givental\nrepresentation to the classical Lie algebras retains this property. It was\nshown elsewhere that the integral recursion operator for gl(l+1)-Whittaker\nfunction in the Givental representation coincides with a degeneration of the\nBaxter Q-operator for $\\hat{gl(l+1)}$-Toda chains. We construct Q-operator for\naffine Lie algebras $\\hat{so(2l)}$, $\\hat{so(2l+1)}$ and a twisted form of\n$\\hat{gl(2l)}$.

In this note we\npresent some numerical results of the transition matrix for these bases. In\nparticular we will see that the determinant of the transition matrix is a power\nof 2. This is not a surprising fact. However the explicit formula involves an\ninteresting combinatorial feature.\n  Our compound basis comes from the twisted homogeneous realization of the\nbasic representation of the affine Lie algebras.\n  This note is not written in a standard style of mathematical articles. It is\nmore like a draft of a talk. In particular proofs are not given here. Details\nand proofs will be published elsewhere.\n",

We prove this\nstatement in cases where the image of the momentum map in question lies in the\nset of strongly elliptic elements, the set of elements of $\\g^*$ with compact\nstabilisers. This assumption on the image of the momentum map is equivalent to\nthe assumption that $M = G \\times_K N$, for a compact Hamiltonian $K$-manifold\n$N$. The proof comes down to a reduction to the compact case. This reduction is\nbased on a `quantisation commutes with induction'-principle, and involves a\nnotion of induction of Hamiltonian group actions. This principle, in turn, is\nbased on a version of the naturality of the assembly map for the inclusion of\n$K$ into $G$.\n",

First, we define relevant notions of size for both a\nhomology class and a homology group basis, using ideas from relative homology.\nSecond, we propose an algorithm to compute the optimal homology basis, using\ntechniques from persistent homology and finite field algebra. Classes of the\ncomputed optimal basis are localized with cycles conveying their sizes. The\nalgorithm runs in $O(\\beta^4 n^3 \\log^2 n)$ time, where $n$ is the size of the\nsimplicial complex and $\\beta$ is the Betti number of the homology group.\n",

        "abstract": "  Configurations of rigid collections of saddle connections are connected\ncomponent invariants for strata of the moduli space of quadratic differentials.\nThey have been classified for strata of Abelian differentials by Eskin, Masur\nand Zorich. Similar work for strata of quadratic differentials has been done in\nMasur and Zorich, although in that case the connected components were not\ndistinguished. We classify the configurations for quadratic differentials on\nthe Riemann sphere and on hyperelliptic connected components of the moduli\nspace of quadratic differentials. We show that, in genera greater than five,\nany configuration that appears in the hyperelliptic connected component of a\nstratum also appears in the non-hyperelliptic one.\n",

Additionally, we use the local tangent-normal\ndecomposition, available when the symmetry group is proper, to construct local\nskew-product splittings in a neighborhood of any point in the open and dense\nprincipal orbit type. The general methods introduced in the first part of the\npaper are then adapted to the Hamiltonian case, which is studied with special\ncare and illustrated with several examples. The Hamiltonian category deserves a\nseparate study since in that situation the presence of symmetries implies in\nmost cases the existence of conservation laws, mathematically described via\nmomentum maps, that should be taken into account in the analysis.\n",

Our aim is to find\ncriteria for para-(co)cyclicity of Z^*. Construction is built on a distributive\nlaw of T_l with a second (co)monad T_r on M, a natural transformation i:\\Pi T_l\n\\to \\Pi T_r, and a morphism w: T_r X \\to T_l X in M. The relations i and w need\nto satisfy are categorical versions of Kaygun's axioms of a transposition map.\nMotivation comes from the observation that a (co)ring T over an algebra R\ndetermines a distributive law of two (co)monads T_l=T \\otimes_R (-) and T_r =\n(-)\\otimes_R T on the category of R-bimodules. The functor \\Pi can be chosen\nsuch that Z^n= T\\hat{\\otimes}_R... \\hat{\\otimes}_R T \\hat{\\otimes}_R X is the\ncyclic R-module tensor product. A natural transformation i:T \\hat{\\otimes}_R\n(-) \\to (-) \\hat{\\otimes}_R T is given by the flip map and a morphism w: X\n\\otimes_R T \\to T\\otimes_R X is constructed whenever T is a (co)module algebra\nor coring of an R-bialgebroid. Stable anti Yetter-Drinfel'd modules over\ncertain bialgebroids, so called x_R-Hopf algebras, are introduced. In the\nparticular example when T is a module coring of a x_R-Hopf algebra B and X is a\nstable anti Yetter-Drinfel'd B-module, the para-cyclic object Z_* is shown to\nproject to a cyclic structure on T^{\\otimes_R *+1} \\otimes_B X. For a B-Galois\nextension S \\to T, a stable anti Yetter-Drinfel'd B-module T_S is constructed,\nsuch that the cyclic objects B^{\\otimes_R *+1} \\otimes_B T_S and T^\n{\\hat{\\otimes}_S *+1} are isomorphic. As an application, we compute Hochschild\nand cyclic homology of a groupoid with coefficients, by tracing it back to the\ngroup case. In particular, we obtain explicit expressions for ordinary\nHochschild and cyclic homology of a groupoid.\n",

The vector\nspace consisting of all rational functions whose Taylor expansions at zero are\nfixed by phi_{s,t} was previously classified by constructing a basis that is\npartially indexed by integers that are distinguished with respect to the pair\n(s,t). In this paper, we study the properties of the set of distinguished\nintegers with respect to (s,t). In particular, we demonstrate that the set of\ndistinguished integers with respect to (s,t) can be written as a union of\ninfinitely many arithmetic progressions. In addition, we construct another\ngenerating set for the collection of rational functions that are fixed by\nphi_{s,t} and discuss the relationship between this generating set and the\nbasis that was generated previously.\n",

This structure acts as an open-loop proportional controller, after\na setpoint change, and as a closed-loop integrating controller, when the error\nenters in a preset band. A chart, provided with the borderlines of the\nstability zone and with the curves of two design parameters, is implemented for\neach controller. The first parameter is the overshoot of the controlled\nvariable, evaluated during a step change of the setpoint and made equal to a\npreset value. The second parameter, only for the PI and SP controllers, is the\nintegral of the squared error (ISE), which must have the minimum allowable\nvalue. The ISE is also assumed as comparison index and the proposed controller\nappears as the best.\n",

Next we give a\ncombinatorial criterion for a prime ideal that is invariant under the torus\naction to be primitive. We use this criterion to obtain a formula for the\nnumber of primitive ideals in the algebra of $2\\times n$ quantum matrices that\nare invariant under the action of the torus. Roughly speaking, this can be\nthought of as giving an enumeration of the points that are invariant under the\ninduced action of the torus in the ``variety of $2\\times n$ quantum matrices''.\n",

I found Thomas Heath, \"A\nhistory of Greek mathematics\", vol. I, chapter VII to be helpful, in particular\npp. 226-230. The quadratrix is a \"mechanical curve\" that can be used to rectify\nthe circle. The usual problem of squaring the circle is to construct a square\nwith the same area (or perimeter) as a given circle, in a finite number of\nsteps using compass and straightedge. Descartes worked in the reverse\ndirection: from a given square he constructed the radius of a circle with the\nsame perimeter, but in an infinite number of steps.\n  In this paper Euler reconstructs Descartes' argument and develops some\nconsequences of it. Euler finds that \\[ \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2^n} \\tan\n\\frac{1}{2^n}\\phi = \\frac{1}{\\phi} - 2\\cot 2\\phi. \\] Integrating this yields \\[\n\\prod_{n=1}^\\infty \\sec \\frac{1}{2^n} \\phi = \\frac{2\\phi}{\\sin 2\\phi}. \\]\n  I'd like to thank Davide Crippa from the University of Paris 7 for some\nhelpful back and forth about this paper.\n  One of the only citations to this paper that I have found is in Pietro\nFerroni, De calculo integralium exercitatio mathematica, Allegrini, Florence,\n1792, pp. xxi--xxiii.

In\nparticular, it gives sufficient conditions for existence of an extension of a\n(pro)monoidal category structure along a given dense functor to a cocomplete\ncategory. The two basic procedures used in the proof turn out to be special\ncases of the final result, the two respective dense functors then being the\nYoneda embedding followed by a localisation. The final result has a standard\nuniversal property based on left Kan extension of (pro)monoidal functors along\nthe given dense functor, however this property is not stated explicitly here.\n",

Sufficient\nconditions for a rational Poisson action of a torus on such an algebra to leave\nonly finitely many Poisson prime ideals invariant are obtained. Combined with\nprevious work of the first-named author, this establishes the Poisson\nDixmier-Moeglin equivalence for large classes of Poisson polynomial rings, such\nas semiclassical limits of quantum matrices, quantum symplectic and euclidean\nspaces, quantum symmetric and antisymmetric matrices. For a similarly large\nclass of Poisson polynomial rings, it is proved that the quotient field of the\nalgebra (respectively, of any Poisson prime factor ring) is a rational function\nfield $F(x_1,...,x_n)$ over the base field (respectively, over an extension\nfield of the base field) with $\\{x_i,x_j\\}= \\lambda_{ij} x_ix_j$ for suitable\nscalars $\\lambda_{ij}$, thus establishing a quadratic Poisson version of the\nGel'fand-Kirillov problem. Finally, partial solutions to the isomorphism\nproblem for Poisson fields of the type just mentioned are obtained.\n",

These bialgebras can be described as\ndeformed bosonizations $R#_{\\xi} H$ of a pre-bialgebra $R$ by $H$ with a\ncocycle $\\xi$. Here we describe the behavior of $\\xi$ in the case when $R$ is\nf.d. and thin i.e. it is connected with one dimensional space of primitive\nelements. This is used to analyze the arithmetic properties of $A$. Meaningful\nresults are obtained when $H$ is cosemisimple. By means of Ore extension\nconstruction, we provide some examples of atypical situations (e.g. the\nmultiplication of $R$ is not $H$-colinear or $\\xi$ is non-trivial).\n",

This results in filters suitable for nonlinear problems whose\nsolutions exhibit moving coherent features, such as thin interfaces in wildfire\nmodeling. The ensemble members are represented as the composition of one common\nstate with a spatial transformation, called registration mapping, plus a\nresidual. A fully automatic registration method is used that requires only\ngridded data, so the features in the model state do not need to be identified\nby the user. The morphing EnKF operates on a transformed state consisting of\nthe registration mapping and the residual. Essentially, the morphing EnKF uses\nintermediate states obtained by morphing instead of linear combinations of the\nstates.\n",

In the\nalgebraic case a polymorphism is a correspondence in the sense of algebraic\ngeometry, but here we investigate it from a dynamical point of view. The most\nimportant examples are the algebraic polymorphisms of torus, where we introduce\na parametrization of the semigroup of toral polymorphisms in terms of rational\nmatrices and describe the spectra of the corresponding Markov operators.\n",

We show:\n  Each curve in the tightened sweepout whose length is close to the length of\nthe longest curve in the sweepout must itself be close to a closed geodesic. In\nparticular, there are curves in the sweepout that are close to closed\ngeodesics.\n  Finding closed geodesics on the 2-sphere by using sweepouts goes back to\nBirkhoff in 1917.\n  As an application, we bound from above, by a negative constant, the rate of\nchange of the width for a one-parameter family of convex hypersurfaces that\nflows by mean curvature. The width is loosely speaking up to a constant the\nsquare of the length of the shortest closed curve needed to ``pull over'' $M$.\nThis estimate is sharp and leads to a sharp estimate for the extinction time;\ncf.

Generalizing this notion we define the incidence class of two\norbits X and Y of a representation. We give a sufficient condition (positivity)\nfor Y to have the property that the incidence class $[X]|_Y$ is not zero if and\nonly if Y is in the closure of X for any other orbit X. We show that for many\ninteresting cases, e.g. the quiver representations of Dynkin type positivity\nholds for all orbits. In other words in these cases the incidence classes\ncompletely determine the hierarchy of the orbits. We also study the case of\nsingularities where positivity doesn't hold for all orbits.\n",

These discrete-time models are\nbased on a discrete variational principle, and are part of the broader field of\ngeometric integration. Geometric integrators are numerical integration methods\nthat preserve geometric properties of continuous systems, such as conservation\nof the symplectic form, momentum, and energy. They also guarantee that the\ndiscrete flow remains on the manifold on which the continuous system evolves,\nan important property in the case of rigid-body dynamics.\n  In nonlinear control, one typically relies on differential geometric and\ndynamical systems techniques to prove properties such as stability,\ncontrollability, and optimality. More generally, the geometric structure of\nsuch systems plays a critical role in the nonlinear analysis of the\ncorresponding control problems. Despite the critical role of geometry and\nmechanics in the analysis of nonlinear control systems, nonlinear control\nalgorithms have typically been implemented using numerical schemes that ignore\nthe underlying geometry.\n  The field of discrete control system aims to address this deficiency by\nrestricting the approximation to choice of a discrete-time model, and\ndeveloping an associated control theory that does not introduce any additional\napproximation. In particular, this involves the construction of a control\ntheory for discrete-time models based on geometric integrators that yields\nnumerical implementations of nonlinear and geometric control algorithms that\npreserve the crucial underlying geometric structure.\n",

We also\npresent a simpler proof of the result of Cochran-Teichner that the successive\nquotients of the integral terms of the Cochran-Orr-Teichner filtration of the\nknot concordance group have rank 1. For links we have similar results. We show\nthat the iterated Bing doubles of many algebraically slice knots are not\ntopologically slice. Some of the proofs do not use the existence of the\nCheeger-Gromov bound, a deep analytical tool used by Cochran-Teichner. Our main\nexamples are actually boundary links but cannot be detected in the algebraic\nboundary link concordance group, nor by any $\\rho$ invariants associated to\nsolvable representations into finite unitary groups.\n",

This paper discusses\nwhether $S$ can be represented as the projection of some LMI representable set.\nSuch $S$ is called semidefinite representable or SDP representable. The\ncontributions of this paper: {\\bf (i)} Assume $g_i(x)$ are all concave on $S$.\nIf the positive definite Lagrange Hessian (PDLH) condition holds, i.e., the\nHessian of the Lagrange function for optimization problem of minimizing any\nnonzero linear function $\\ell^Tx$ on $S$ is positive definite at the minimizer,\nthen $S$ is SDP representable. {\\bf (ii)} If each $g_i(x)$ is either\nsos-concave ($-\\nabla^2g_i(x)=W(x)^TW(x)$ for some possibly nonsquare matrix\npolynomial $W(x)$) or strictly quasi-concave on $S$, then $S$ is SDP\nrepresentable. {\\bf (iii)} If each $S_i$ is either sos-convex or poscurv-convex\n($S_i$ is compact convex, whose boundary has positive curvature and is\nnonsingular, i.e. $\\nabla g_i(x) \\not = 0$ on $\\bdS_i \\cap S$), then $S$ is SDP\nrepresentable. This also holds for $S_i$ for which $\\bdS_i \\cap S$ extends\nsmoothly to the boundary of a poscurv-convex set containing $S$. {\\bf (iv)} We\ngive the complexity of Schm\\\"{u}dgen and Putinar's matrix Positivstellensatz,\nwhich are critical to the proofs of (i)-(iii).\n",

A well known\nresult of Wall, the so called $\\pi$-$\\pi$ theorem, states that in higher\ndimensions a normal map of a manifold with boundary to a simple Poincare pair\nwith $\\pi_1(X)\\cong\\pi_1(Y)$ is normally bordant to a simple homotopy\nequivalence of pairs. In order to study normal maps to a manifold with a\nsubmanifold, Wall introduced surgery obstruction group for manifold pairs\n$LP_*$ and splitting obstruction groups $LS_*$. In the present paper we\nformulate and prove for manifold pairs with boundaries the results which are\nsimilar to the $\\pi$-$\\pi$ theorem. We give direct geometric proofs, which are\nbased on the original statements of Wall's results and apply obtained results\nto investigate surgery on filtered manifolds.\n",

The quantity to be controlled is the trace\nof the solution into an open subdomain and at a given time, when the right hand\nside source term is known. The mapping that associates this trace to the shape\nof the domain is nonlinear. We show (i) an approximate controllability property\nfor the linearized parabolic problem and (ii) an exact local controllability\nproperty for the linearized and the nonlinear equations in the hyperbolic case.\nWe then address the same questions in the context of a finite difference\nspatial semi-discretization in both the parabolic and hyperbolic problems. In\nthis discretized case again we prove a local controllability result for the\nparabolic problem, and an exact controllability for the hyperbolic case,\napplying a local surjectivity theorem together with a unique continuation\nproperty of the underlying adjoint discrete system.\n",

What is\nless widely known, is that there is a state similar to full ignorance, that\nWalley calls near-ignorance, that permits learning to take place. In this paper\nwe provide new and substantial evidence that also near-ignorance cannot be\nreally regarded as a way out of the problem of starting statistical inference\nin conditions of very weak beliefs. The key to this result is focusing on a\nsetting characterized by a variable of interest that is latent. We argue that\nsuch a setting is by far the most common case in practice, and we show, for the\ncase of categorical latent variables (and general manifest variables) that\nthere is a sufficient condition that, if satisfied, prevents learning to take\nplace under prior near-ignorance. This condition is shown to be easily\nsatisfied in the most common statistical problems.\n",

This paper proposes a new estimation approach for\nsolving a class of inverse problems in network tomography, based on marginal\ndistributions of a sequence of one-dimensional linear projections of the\nobserved data. We give a general identifiability result for the proposed method\nand study the design issue of these one dimensional projections in terms of\nstatistical efficiency. We show that for a simple Gaussian tomography model,\nthere is an optimal set of one-dimensional projections such that the estimator\nobtained from these projections is asymptotically as efficient as the maximum\nlikelihood estimator based on the joint distribution of the observed data. For\npractical applications, we carry out simulation studies of the proposed method\nfor two instances of network tomography. The first is for traffic demand\ntomography using a Gaussian Origin-Destination traffic model with a power\nrelation between its mean and variance, and the second is for network delay\ntomography where the link delays are to be estimated from the end-to-end path\ndelays. We compare estimators obtained from our method and that obtained from\nusing the joint distribution and other lower dimensional projections, and show\nthat in both cases, the proposed method yields satisfactory results.\n",

As\n  pointed out by Bena Tshishiku, Borel's theorem on the cohomology stable range\n  for arithmetic groups is incorrectly quoted and applied in this paper; in the\n  case relevant to K3 surfaces the range is unfortunately zero. Hence the proof\n  of the part of Theorem 1.1 referring to K3 surfaces is fundamentally broken.\n  See arXiv:1711.03139",

        "abstract": "  The Nielsen Realization problem asks when the group homomorphism from Diff(M)\nto pi_0 Diff(M) admits a section. For M a closed surface, Kerckhoff proved that\na section exists over any finite subgroup, but Morita proved that if the genus\nis large enough then no section exists over the entire mapping class group. We\nprove the first nonexistence theorem of this type in dimension 4: if M is a\nsmooth closed oriented 4-manifold which contains a K3 surface as a connected\nsummand then no section exists over the whole of the mapping class group. This\nis done by showing that certain obstructions lying in the rational cohomology\nof B(pi_0 Diff(M)) are nonzero. We detect these classes by showing that they\nare nonzero when pulled back to the moduli space of Einstein metrics on a K3\nsurface.\n",

In this\npaper we define the almost-free finite covers of W with respect to r, and we\nshow how to construct them. These are a generalization of free finite covers. A\nconsequence of a result of Evans and Hrushovski in the paper \"On the\nautomorphism groups of finite covers\" is that any finite cover of W with\nbinding groups all equal to a simple non-abelian permutation group is\nalmost-free with respect to some r on W. Our main result gives a description\n(up to isomorphism) in terms of the Aut(W)-congruences on W of the kernels of\nprincipal finite covers of W with bindings groups equal at any point to a\nsimple non-abelian regular permutation group G. Then we analyze almost-free\nfinite covers of the set of ordered n-tuples of distinct elements from a\ncountable set Omega, regarded as a structure with automorphism group equal to\nthe Sym(Omega) and we show a result of biinterpretability.\n",

Usually such theories have world sheet noncommutativity.\nIn the present work, instead, we study QFT's with commutative world sheet and\nnoncommutative target space. Such noncommutativity can be interpreted in terms\nof twisted statistics and is related to earlier work of Oeckl [1], and others\n[2,3,4,5,6,7,8]. The twisted spectra of their free Hamiltonians has been found\nearlier by Carmona et al [9,10]. We review their derivation and then compute\nthe partition function of one such typical theory. It leads to a deformed black\nbody spectrum, which is analysed in detail. The difference between the usual\nand the deformed black body spectrum appears in the region of high frequencies.\nTherefore we expect that the deformed black body radiation may potentially be\nused to compute a GZK cut-off which will depend on the noncommutative parameter\n$\\theta$.\n",

        "abstract": "  Within the program of finding axiomatizations for various parts of\ncomputability logic, it was proved earlier that the logic of interactive Turing\nreduction is exactly the implicative fragment of Heyting's intuitionistic\ncalculus. That sort of reduction permits unlimited reusage of the computational\nresource represented by the antecedent. An at least equally basic and natural\nsort of algorithmic reduction, however, is the one that does not allow such\nreusage. The present article shows that turning the logic of the first sort of\nreduction into the logic of the second sort of reduction takes nothing more\nthan just deleting the contraction rule from its Gentzen-style axiomatization.\nThe first (Turing) sort of interactive reduction is also shown to come in three\nnatural versions. While those three versions are very different from each\nother, their logical behaviors (in isolation) turn out to be indistinguishable,\nwith that common behavior being precisely captured by implicative\nintuitionistic logic. Among the other contributions of the present article is\nan informal introduction of a series of new -- finite and bounded -- versions\nof recurrence operations and the associated reduction operations.

Using the genus one correlation functions, it is shown that self-dual\nSVOAs exist only for half-integral central charges. It is described how\nself-dual SVOAs can be constructed from self-dual VOAs of larger central\ncharge. The analogy with integral lattices and binary codes is emphasized.\n  One main result is the construction of the shorter Moonshine module, a\nself-dual SVOA of central charge 23.5 on which the Baby monster - the second\nlargest sporadic simple group - acts by automorphisms. The shorter Moonshine\nmodule has the character q^(-47/48)*(1+ 4371q^(3/2)+ 96256q^2+ 1143745q^(5/2)\n+...) and is the \"shorter cousin\" of the Moonshine module. Its lattice and code\nanalog are the shorter Leech lattice and shorter Golay code. We conjecture that\nthe shorter Moonshine module is the unique SVOA with this character.\n  The final chapter introduces the notion of extremal VOAs and SVOAs. These are\nself-dual (S)VOAs with character having the same first few coefficients as the\nvacuum representation of the Virasoro algebra of the same central charge. We\nshow that extremal VOAs exist at least for the central charges 8, 16, 24, 32,\n40 and that extremal SVOAs exist only for the central charges c=0.5, 1, ...,\n7.5, 8, 12, 14, 15, 15.5, 23.5 and 24. Examples for c=24 (resp. 23.5) are the\n(shorter) Moonshine module. Again, our results are similar to results known for\ncodes and lattices.\n",

        "abstract": "  Control systems are usually modeled by differential equations describing how\nphysical phenomena can be influenced by certain control parameters or inputs.\nAlthough these models are very powerful when dealing with physical phenomena,\nthey are less suitable to describe software and hardware interfacing the\nphysical world. For this reason there is a growing interest in describing\ncontrol systems through symbolic models that are abstract descriptions of the\ncontinuous dynamics, where each \"symbol\" corresponds to an \"aggregate\" of\nstates in the continuous model. Since these symbolic models are of the same\nnature of the models used in computer science to describe software and\nhardware, they provide a unified language to study problems of control in which\nsoftware and hardware interact with the physical world. Furthermore the use of\nsymbolic models enables one to leverage techniques from supervisory control and\nalgorithms from game theory for controller synthesis purposes. In this paper we\nshow that every incrementally globally asymptotically stable nonlinear control\nsystem is approximately equivalent (bisimilar) to a symbolic model. The\napproximation error is a design parameter in the construction of the symbolic\nmodel and can be rendered as small as desired. Furthermore if the state space\nof the control system is bounded the obtained symbolic model is finite. For\ndigital control systems, and under the stronger assumption of incremental\ninput-to-state stability, symbolic models can be constructed through a suitable\nquantization of the inputs.\n",

Namely,\nwe categorify the well known relationship between free loop spaces, cyclic\nhomology and de Rham cohomology to recover the category of D-modules on a\nsmooth stack X as a localization of the category of S^1-equivariant coherent\nsheaves on its loop space LX. The main observation is that this procedure\nconnects categories of equivariant D-modules on flag varieties with categories\nof equivariant coherent sheaves on the Steinberg variety and its relatives.\nThis provides a direct connection between the geometry of finite and affine\nHecke algebras and braid groups, and a uniform geometric construction of all of\nthe categorical parameters for representations of real and complex reductive\ngroups. This paper forms the first step in a project to apply the geometric\nLanglands program to the complex and real local Langlands programs, which we\ndescribe.\n",

This extends the definition of ratio vectors\ngiven in earlier papers for polynomials of degree $n$ with all real roots.

These actions are extremely useful for\ncomputational problems in Schubert calculus. The (torus) equivariant cohomology\nof the flag variety is constructed using the combinatorial description of\nGoresky-Kottwitz-MacPherson, discussed in detail. Two permutation\nrepresentations on equivariant and ordinary cohomology are identified in terms\nof irreducible representations of the permutation group. We show how to use the\npermutation actions to construct divided difference operators and to give\nformulas for some localizations of certain equivariant classes.\n  This paper includes several new results, in particular a new proof of the\nChevalley-Monk formula and a proof that one of the natural permutation\nrepresentations on the equivariant cohomology of the flag variety is the\nregular representation. Many examples, exercises, and open questions are\nprovided.\n",

We give necessary and\nsufficient conditions for the absence of utility-based arbitrage, and for the\nexistence of a solution to the primal problem.\n  We consider two utility-based methods which can be used to price contingent\nclaims.

We show that such processes can be characterized as local\nmartingales under the normalized optimal dual measure for the utility\nmaximizing investor.

Every\nt-structure on D^b_fg(R) (equivalently, on D^-_fg(R)) is induced by complactly\ngenerated t-structures on D(R) whose associated filtrations by supports satisfy\nthe weak Cousin condition. If the ring R has dualizing complex we prove that\nthese are exactly the t-structures on D^b_fg(R).

The\nconstruction of covering homology is extracted from Bokstedt, Hsiang and\nMadsen's topological cyclic homology. In fact covering homology with respect to\nthe family of orientation preserving isogenies of the circle is equal to\ntopological cyclic homology.\n  Our basic tool for the analysis of covering homology is a cofibration\nsequence involving homotopy orbits and a restriction map similar to the\nrestriction map used in Bokstedt, Hsiang and Madsen's construction of\ntopological cyclic homology.\n  Covering homology with respect to families of isogenies of a torus is\nconstructed from iterated topological Hochschild homology. It receives a trace\nmap from iterated algebraic K-theory and the hope is that the rich structure,\nand the calculability of covering homology will make covering homology useful\nin the exploration of J. Rognes' ``red shift conjecture''.\n",

Under the\nhypothesis that some spanning tree structure is preserved along time, and that\nsome nonzero minimal weight of the information transfer along this tree is\nguaranteed, an estimate of the contraction rate is given. The latter is\nexpressed explicitly as the spectral radius of some matrix depending upon the\ntree depth and the lower bounds on the weights.\n",

The pioneering work by Nowak and May showed that large\ninitial populations of cooperators can survive and sustain cooperation in a\nsquare lattice with imitate-the-best evolutionary dynamics. We revisit this\nproblem in a cost-benefit formulation suitable for a number of biological\napplications. We show that if a fixed-amount reward is established for\ncooperators to share, a single cooperator can invade a population of defectors\nand form structures that are resilient to re-invasion even if the reward\nmechanism is turned off. We discuss analytically the case of the invasion by a\nsingle cooperator and present agent-based simulations for small initial\nfractions of cooperators. Large cooperation levels, in the sustainability\nrange, are found. In the conclusions we discuss possible applications of this\nmodel as well as its connections with other mechanisms proposed to promote the\nemergence of cooperation.\n",

New marginal central limit theorems (CLT's) are established for\nthese estimators, assuming the existence of four moments for the measurement\nerrors and that the explanatory variables are in the domain of attraction of\nthe normal law. The latter condition for the explanatory variables is used the\nfirst time, and is so far the most general in this context. It is also optimal,\nor nearly optimal, for our CLT's. Moreover, due to the obtained CLT's being in\nStudentized and self-normalized forms to begin with, they are a priori nearly,\nor completely, data-based, and free of unknown parameters of the joint\ndistribution of the error and explanatory variables. Consequently, they lead to\na variety of readily available, or easily derivable, large-sample approximate\nconfidence intervals (CI's) for the slope and intercept. In contrast, in\nrelated CLT's in the literature so far, the variances of the limiting normal\ndistributions, in general, are complicated and depend on various, typically\nunknown, moments of the error and explanatory variables. Thus, the\ncorresponding CI's for the slope and intercept in the literature, unlike those\nof the present paper, are available only under some additional model\nassumptions.\n",

Since the existence of such examples would be against our\noriginal target Conjecture$(GJC)$, we have to dispute their arguments about the\nexistence of their respective (so called) counter-examples. Our conclusion is\nthat they are not perfect counter-examples as are shown explicitly.\n",

If A, B and C\ncorrespond to a tower of subgroups G > H > K via the group algebra over a fixed\nbase ring, the depth three condition is the condition that subgroup K has\nnormal closure K^G contained in H. For a depth three tower of rings, there is a\npre-Galois theory for the ring End {}_BA_C and coring (A \\otimes_B A)^C\ninvolving Morita context bimodules and left coideal subrings.

This is a simple consequence of properties of the loop coproduct\nwhich will be discussed in detail. One interesting property is that the loop\ncoproduct is nontrivial only on the degree $d$ homology group of the connected\ncomponent of $LM$ consisting of contractible loops, where $d=\\dim M$, with\nvalues in the degree 0 homology group of constant loops.

Cohen and\nJones gave a homotopy theoretic description of the loop product in terms of\nspectra. In this paper, we give an explicit homotopy theoretic description of\nthe loop bracket and, using this description, we give a homological proof of\nthe BV identity connecting the loop product, the loop bracket, and the BV\noperator. The proof is based on an observation that the loop bracket and the BV\nderivation are given by the same cycle in the free loop space, except that they\ndiffer by parametrization of loops.\n",

This paper presents some preliminary investigations on the\nproblem of mesh numbering using Evolutionary Algorithms. Three conclusions can\nbe drawn from these experiments. First, the results of the up-to-date method\nused in all FEM softwares (Gibb's method) can be consistently improved; second,\nnone of the crossover operators tried so far (either general or problem\nspecific) proved useful; third, though the general tendency in Evolutionary\nComputation seems to be the hybridization with other methods (deterministic or\nheuristic), none of the presented attempt did encounter any success yet. The\ngood news, however, is that this algorithm allows an improvement over the\nstandard heuristic method between 12% and 20% for both the 1545 and 5453-nodes\nmeshes used as test-bed. Finally, some strange interaction between the\nselection scheme and the use of problem specific mutation operator was\nobserved, which appeals for further investigation.\n",

The difference between the change-point estimator of the\nresampled sequence and the one for the original sequence can be use as an\napproximation of the difference between the real change-point and its\nestimator. This enables us to construct confidence intervals using the\nempirical distribution of the resampled time series.\n  A simulation study shows that the resampled confidence intervals are usually\ncloser to their target levels and at the same time smaller than the asymptotic\nintervals.\n",

This tells us how far one has to search\nto find an n so that the ergodic averages are \"locally stable\" on a large\ninterval. We use these bounds to obtain a similarly explicit version of the\npointwise ergodic theorem, and show that our bounds are qualitatively different\nfrom ones that can be obtained using upcrossing inequalities due to Bishop and\nIvanov.

In this paper we generalize these results\nto an arbitrary topos. The fundamental progroupoid is now a localic\nprogroupoid, and can not be replaced by a localic groupoid. The classifying\ntopos in not any more a Galois topos. Not all locally constant objects can be\nconsidered as covering projections. The key contribution of this paper is a\nnovel definition of covering projection for a general topos, which coincides\nwith the usual definition when the topos is locally connected. The results in\nthis paper were presented in a talk at the Category Theory Conference,\nVancouver July 2004.\n",

For such series, the sample\nautocorrelations decay slowly and log-log periodogram plots indicate a\nstraight-line relationship. This necessitates a class of models for describing\nsuch behavior. A popular class of such models is the autoregressive\nfractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA) which is a linear process.\nHowever, there is also a need for nonlinear long memory models. For example,\nseries of returns on financial assets typically tend to show zero correlation,\nwhereas their squares or absolute values exhibit long memory. Furthermore, the\nsearch for a realistic mechanism for generating long memory has led to the\ndevelopment of other nonlinear long memory models. In this chapter, we will\npresent several nonlinear long memory models, and discuss the properties of the\nmodels, as well as associated parametric andsemiparametric estimators.\n",

Classical theory\npresupposes, however, that--at least in principle--the amount of evidence that\nan experimenter can accumulate always matches the size of the hypothesis space.\nI investigate how the framework for consistent reasoning must be modified in\nnon-classical situations where hypotheses form a continuum, yet the maximum\nevidence accessible through experiment is not allowed to exceed some finite\nupper bound. Invoking basic consistency requirements pertaining to the\npreparation and composition of systems, as well as to the continuity of\nprobabilities, I show that the modified theory must have an internal symmetry\nisomorphic to the unitary group. It thus appears that the only consistent\nalgorithm for plausible reasoning about a continuum of hypotheses on the basis\nof finite evidence is furnished by quantum theory in complex Hilbert space.\n",

By this, we mean a morphism U_l from\nthe pointed derivator associated with the Morita homotopy theory of dg\ncategories to a triangulated strong derivator M^loc such that U_l commutes with\nfiltered homotopy colimits, preserves the point, sends each exact sequence of\ndg categories to a triangle and is universal for these properties. Similary, we\nconstruct the `the universal additive invariant of dg categories', i.e. the\nuniversal morphism of derivators U_a to a strong triangulated derivator M^add\nwhich satisfies the first two properties but the third one only for split exact\nsequences. We prove that Waldhausen K-theory appears as a mapping space in the\ntarget of the universal additive invariant. This is the first conceptual\ncharacterization of Quillen-Waldhausen's K-theory since its definition in the\nearly 70's. As an application we obtain for free the higher Chern characters\nfrom K-theory to cyclic homology.\n",

We also prove our Betti\nnumber conjecture in a broad range of cases. An appendix discusses many more\ncases in which our conjecture has been verified computationally and provides a\nnew and more efficient computational approach for computing graded Betti\nnumbers in certain degrees. It also demonstrates how to derive explicit\nconjectural values for the Betti numbers and how to compute splitting types.\n",

We prove that if $1 \\leq q \\leq n-2$ and $b\\Omega$ satisfies $(P_q)$\nand $(P_{n-q-1})$, then $G_{q}$ is a compact operator (and so is $G_{n-1-q}$).\nOur method relies on a jump type formula to represent forms on the boundary,\nand we prove an auxiliary compactness result for an `annulus' between two\npseudoconvex domains. Our results, combined with the known characterization of\ncompactness in the $\\bar{\\partial}$-Neumann problem on locally convexifiable\ndomains, yield the corresponding characterization of compactness of the complex\nGreen operator(s) on these domains.\n",

Our\ncentral observation is that model categories are the objects of a double\ncategory whose vertical and horizontal arrows are left and right Quillen\nfunctors, respectively, and that passage to derived functors is functorial at\nthe level of this double category. The theory of conjunctions and mates in\ndouble categories, which generalizes the theory of adjunctions and mates in\n2-categories, then gives us canonical ways to compare composites of left and\nright derived functors. We give a number of sample applications, most of which\nare improvements of existing proofs in the literature.\n",

An interesting outer-coupling\nrelationship is constructed, under which the $H_2$ norm of the newly\nconstructed network with column-input and row-output shaped matrices increases\nexponentially fast with the node number $N$: it increases generally much faster\nthan $2^N$ when $N$ is large while the $H_2$ norm of each node is 1. However,\nthe $H_2$ norm of the network with a diffusive coupling is equal to $\\gamma_2\nN$, i.e., increasing linearly, when the network is stable, where $\\gamma_2$ is\nthe $H_2$ norm of a single node. And the $H_2$ norm of the network with\nantisymmetrical coupling also increases, but rather slowly, with the node\nnumber $N$. Other networks with block-diagonal-input and block-diagonal-output\nmatrices behave similarly. It demonstrates that the changes of $H_2$ norms in\ndifferent networks are very complicated, despite the fact that the networks are\nlinear. Finally, the influence of the $H_2$ norm of the locally linearized\nnetwork on the output of a network with Lur'e nodes is discussed.\n",

In a later\npaper they extended these results to principal ideals of $F$-finite complete\nregular local rings. The aim of this paper is to extend these results on the\ndiscreteness and rationality of jumping coefficients to principal ideals of\narbitrary (i.e. not necessarily $F$-finite) excellent regular local rings\ncontaining fields of positive characteristic.\n  Our proof uses a very different method: we do not use $D$-modules and instead\nwe analyze the modules of nilpotents elements in the injective hull or $R$\nunder some non-standard Frobenius actions. This new method undoubtedly holds a\npotential for more applications.\n",

This work has\nsubsequently been reworked by H.-H. Wu in 1970, using differential geometry, M.\nCowen and P. A. Griffiths in 1976, further emphasizing curvature, and by Y.-T.\nSiu in 1987 and 1990, emphasizing meromorphic connections. This paper gives\nanother variation of the proof, motivated by successive minima as in the proof\nof Schmidt's Subspace Theorem, and using McQuillan's \"tautological inequality.\"\nIn this proof, essentially all of the analysis is encapsulated within a\nmodified McQuillan-like inequality, so that most of the proof primarily uses\nmethods of algebraic geometry, in particular flag varieties. A diophantine\nconjecture based on McQuillan's inequality is also posed.\n",

        "abstract": "  We consider the four-dimensional nonholonomic distribution defined by the\n4-potential of the electromagnetic field on the manifold. This distribution has\na metric tensor with the Lorentzian signature $(+,-,-,-)$, therefore, the\ncausal structure appears as in the general relativity theory. By means of the\nPontryagin's maximum principle we proved that the equations of the horizontal\ngeodesics for this distribution are the same as the equations of motion of a\ncharged particle in the general relativity theory. This is a Kaluza -- Klein\nproblem of classical and quantum physics solved by methods of sub-Lorentzian\ngeometry. We study the geodesics sphere which appears in a constant magnetic\nfield and its singular points. Sufficiently long geodesics are not optimal\nsolutions of the variational problem and define the nonholonomic wavefront.\nThis wavefront is limited by a convex elliptic cone. We also study variational\nprinciple approach to the problem. The Euler -- Lagrange equations are the same\nas those obtained by the Pontryagin's maximum principle if the restriction of\nthe metric tensor on the distribution is the same.\n",

        "abstract": "  Omega-powers of finitary languages are languages of infinite words\n(omega-languages) in the form V^omega, where V is a finitary language over a\nfinite alphabet X. They appear very naturally in the characterizaton of regular\nor context-free omega-languages. Since the set of infinite words over a finite\nalphabet X can be equipped with the usual Cantor topology, the question of the\ntopological complexity of omega-powers of finitary languages naturally arises\nand has been posed by Niwinski (1990), Simonnet (1992) and Staiger (1997). It\nhas been recently proved that for each integer n > 0, there exist some\nomega-powers of context free languages which are Pi^0_n-complete Borel sets,\nthat there exists a context free language L such that L^omega is analytic but\nnot Borel, and that there exists a finitary language V such that V^omega is a\nBorel set of infinite rank. But it was still unknown which could be the\npossible infinite Borel ranks of omega-powers. We fill this gap here, proving\nthe following very surprising result which shows that omega-powers exhibit a\ngreat topological complexity: for each non-null countable ordinal alpha, there\nexist some Sigma^0_alpha-complete omega-powers, and some Pi^0_alpha-complete\nomega-powers.\n",

The moment map\nis given by the square of curvature so that the 0-level set is the space of\nflat connections. Thus the moduli space of flat connections is endowed with a\npre-symplectic structure. In case when the four-manifold is null-cobordant we\nshall construct, on the moduli space of connections, as well as on that of flat\nconnections, a hermitian line bundle with connection whose curvature is given\nby the pre-symplectic form. This is the Chern-Simons pre-quantum line bundle.\nThe group of gauge transformations on the boundary of the base manifold acts on\nthe moduli space of flat connections by an infinitesimally symplectic way. When\nthe base manifold is a 4-dimensional disc we show that this action is lifted to\nthe pre-quantum line bundle by its abelian extension. The geometric description\nof the latter is related to the 4-dimensional Wess-Zumino-Witten model.

We call this\nassociation Gale duality because the exponents of the monomials in the\npolynomials annihilate the weights of the master functions.

The second one states that if $R$ is a Gorenstein ring with\nfinite F-representation type, then $H_I^n(R)$ has only finitely many associated\nprimes for any ideal $I$ of $R$ and any integer $n$. We also include a result\non the discreteness of F-jumping exponents of ideals of rings with finite\n(graded) F-representation type as an appendix.\n",

In\nthe context of panel time series where one observes data from several\nindividuals, it is often too strong to assume the joint linearity of processes.\nInstead the methods developed in this paper enable us to quantify the\ndependence through 2-mixing which allows for nonlinearity. We propose an\nestimator of the panel mean function and obtain its rate of convergence.

        "abstract": "  In this paper we study a class of stochastic control problems in which the\ncontrol of the jump size is essential. Such a model is a generalized version\nfor various applied problems ranging from optimal reinsurance selections for\ngeneral insurance models to queueing theory. The main novel point of such a\ncontrol problem is that by changing the jump size of the system, one\nessentially changes the type of the driving martingale. Such a feature does not\nseem to have been investigated in any existing stochastic control literature.\nWe shall first provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for the control\nproblem by establishing an existence result for the multidimensional structure\nequation on a Wiener--Poisson space, given an arbitrary bounded jump size\ncontrol process; and by providing an auxiliary counterexample showing the\nnonuniqueness for such solutions. Based on these theoretical results, we then\nformulate the control problem and prove the Bellman principle, and derive the\ncorresponding Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation, which in this case is a\nmixed second-order partial differential/difference equation. Finally, we prove\na uniqueness result for the viscosity solution of such an HJB equation.\n",

We consider the problem of approximating a function belonging\nto an arbitrary real-valued RKHS on R^d based on approximate observations of\nthe function. The observations are approximate in the sense that the actual\nobservations (i.e., the true function values) are known only to belong to a\nconvex set of admissible observations. We seek a minimax optimal approximation\nfor the function that minimizes the supremum of the RKHS norm on the error\nbetween the true function and the chosen approximation subject only to the\nconditions that the true function belongs to a uniformly bounded uncertainty\nset of functions that satisfy the constraints on the observations and that the\napproximation is a member of the RKHS. We refer to such a solution as a minimax\nrobust reconstruction. We characterize the solution to the minimax robust\nreconstruction problem and show that it is equivalent to solving a\nstraightforward convex optimization problem. We demonstrate that a minimax\nrobust reconstruction will generally be more stable than an approximation based\non interpolation through a nominal set of observations and that, subject to\nsome mild regularity conditions on the convex set of admissible observations,\nthe minimax robust reconstruction is unconditionally stable. We motivate our\nresults by characterizing the minimax robust reconstruction for several\nspecific convex observational models and discuss relationships with other\napproaches to function approximation.\n",

The main result\nstates that if there exists an n-times continuously differentiable Lyapunov\nfunction which proves exponential stability on a bounded subset of R^n, then\nthere exists a polynomial Lyapunov function which proves exponential stability\non the same region. Such a continuous Lyapunov function will exist if, for\nexample, the right-hand side of the differential equation is polynomial or at\nleast n-times continuously differentiable. The proof is based on a\ngeneralization of the Weierstrass approximation theorem to differentiable\nfunctions in several variables. Specifically, we show how to use polynomials to\napproximate a differentiable function in the Sobolev norm W^{1,\\infty} to any\ndesired accuracy. We combine this approximation result with the second-order\nTaylor series expansion to find that polynomial Lyapunov functions can\napproximate continuous Lyapunov functions arbitrarily well on bounded sets. Our\ninvestigation is motivated by the use of polynomial optimization algorithms to\nconstruct polynomial Lyapunov functions.\n",

It turns out to be quite different from the unitary case. we use\nLaumon and Rapoport's method in \"The Langlands lemma and the Betti numbers of\nstacks of G-bundles on a curve\" to invert the Atiyah-Bott recursion relation,\nand write down explicit formulas of rational equivariant Poincar\\'{e} series of\nthe semistable stratum of the space of holomorphic structures on a principal\n$SO(n,\\bC)$-bundle or a principal $Sp(n,\\bC)$-bundle.\n",

Our proposed statistical\ntheory suggests that two testing signals of different strength be used. The\nmaximum likelihood (ML) estimator is obtained for estimation of the statistical\nparameters of the Rayleigh fading channel that is both sufficient and complete\nstatistic. Moreover, the ML estimator is the minimum variance (MV) estimator\nthat in fact achieves the Cramer-Rao lower bound.\n",

Our case is made in\nterms of toric spaces X_K, such as moment-angle complexes Z_K, quasitoric\nmanifolds M, and Davis-Januszkiewicz spaces DJ(K). We first exhibit X_K as the\nhomotopy colimit of a diagram of spaces over the small category cat(K), whose\nobjects are the faces of a finite simplicial complex K and morphisms their\ninclusions. Then we study the corresponding cat(K)-diagrams in various\nalgebraic Quillen model categories, and interpret their homotopy colimits as\nalgebraic models for X_K. Such models encode many standard algebraic\ninvariants, and their existence is assured by the Quillen structure. We provide\nseveral illustrative calculations, often over the rationals, including proofs\nthat quasitoric manifolds (and various generalisations) are rationally formal;\nthat the rational Pontrjagin ring of the loop space \\Omega DJ(K) is isomorphic\nto the quadratic dual of the Stanley-Reisner algebra Q[K] for flag complexes K;\nand that DJ(K) is coformal precisely when K is flag. We conclude by describing\nalgebraic models for the loop space \\Omega DJ(K) for any complex K, which mimic\nour previous description as a homotopy colimit of topological monoids.\n",

An optimal solutions to such a problem is\ntypically computed using the value function, which can be found by solving the\ncorresponding dynamic programming equations.

        "abstract": "  In the context of multiple hypotheses testing, the proportion $\\pi_0$ of true\nnull hypotheses in the pool of hypotheses to test often plays a crucial role,\nalthough it is generally unknown a priori. A testing procedure using an\nimplicit or explicit estimate of this quantity in order to improve its\nefficency is called adaptive. In this paper, we focus on the issue of False\nDiscovery Rate (FDR) control and we present new adaptive multiple testing\nprocedures with control of the FDR. First, in the context of assuming\nindependent $p$-values, we present two new procedures and give a unified review\nof other existing adaptive procedures that have provably controlled FDR. We\nreport extensive simulation results comparing these procedures and testing\ntheir robustness when the independence assumption is violated. The new proposed\nprocedures appear competitive with existing ones. The overall best, though, is\nreported to be Storey's estimator, but for a parameter setting that does not\nappear to have been considered before. Second, we propose adaptive versions of\nstep-up procedures that have provably controlled FDR under positive dependences\nand unspecified dependences of the $p$-values, respectively. While simulations\nonly show an improvement over non-adaptive procedures in limited situations,\nthese are to our knowledge among the first theoretically founded adaptive\nmultiple testing procedures that control the FDR when the $p$-values are not\nindependent.\n",

        "abstract": "  In climate studies, detecting spatial patterns that largely deviate from the\nsample mean still remains a statistical challenge. Although a Principal\nComponent Analysis (PCA), or equivalently a Empirical Orthogonal Functions\n(EOF) decomposition, is often applied on this purpose, it can only provide\nmeaningful results if the underlying multivariate distribution is Gaussian.\nIndeed, PCA is based on optimizing second order moments quantities and the\ncovariance matrix can only capture the full dependence structure for\nmultivariate Gaussian vectors. Whenever the application at hand can not satisfy\nthis normality hypothesis (e.g. precipitation data), alternatives and/or\nimprovements to PCA have to be developed and studied. To go beyond this second\norder statistics constraint that limits the applicability of the PCA, we take\nadvantage of the cumulant function that can produce higher order moments\ninformation. This cumulant function, well-known in the statistical literature,\nallows us to propose a new, simple and fast procedure to identify spatial\npatterns for non-Gaussian data. Our algorithm consists in maximizing the\ncumulant function. To illustrate our approach, its implementation for which\nexplicit computations are obtained is performed on three family of of\nmultivariate random vectors. In addition, we show that our algorithm\ncorresponds to selecting the directions along which projected data display the\nlargest spread over the marginal probability density tails.\n",

        "abstract": "  This paper offers a critical view of the \"worst-case\" approach that is the\ncornerstone of robust control design. It is our contention that a blind\nacceptance of worst-case scenarios may lead to designs that are actually more\ndangerous than designs based on probabilistic techniques with a built-in risk\nfactor. The real issue is one of modeling. If one accepts that no mathematical\nmodel of uncertainties is perfect then a probabilistic approach can lead to\nmore reliable control even if it cannot guarantee stability for all possible\ncases. Our presentation is based on case analysis. We first establish that\nworst-case is not necessarily \"all-encompassing.\" In fact, we show that for\nsome uncertain control problems to have a conventional robust control solution\nit is necessary to make assumptions that leave out some feasible cases. Once we\nestablish that point, we argue that it is not uncommon for the risk of\nunaccounted cases in worst-case design to be greater than that of the accepted\nrisk in a probabilistic approach. With an example, we quantify the risks and\nshow that worst-case can be significantly more risky. Finally, we join our\nanalysis with existing results on computational complexity and probabilistic\nrobustness to argue that the deterministic worst-case analysis is not\nnecessarily the better tool.\n",

We will establish the\ndynamic programming principle for the upper and the lower value functions of\nthis kind of stochastic differential games with reflection in a\nstraight-forward way. Then the upper and the lower value functions are proved\nto be the unique viscosity solutions of the associated upper and the lower\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs equations with obstacles, respectively. The\nmethod differs heavily from those used for control problems with reflection, it\nhas its own techniques and its own interest. On the other hand, we also prove a\nnew estimate for RBSDEs being sharper than that in El Karoui, Kapoudjian,\nPardoux, Peng and Quenez [7], which turns out to be very useful because it\nallows to estimate the $L^p$-distance of the solutions of two different RBSDEs\nby the $p$-th power of the distance of the initial values of the driving\nforward equations. We also show that the unique viscosity solution of the\napproximating Isaacs equation which is constructed by the penalization method\nconverges to the viscosity solution of the Isaacs equation with obstacle.\n",

A\ngraded module over $H^*A$ is called \\emph{realisable} if it is (up to direct\nsummands) of the form $H^*M$ for some differential graded $A$-module $M$.\nBenson, Krause and Schwede have stated a local and a global obstruction for\nrealisability. The global obstruction is given by the Hochschild class\ndetermined by the secondary multiplication of the $A_{\\infty}$-algebra\nstructure of $H^*A$.\n  In this thesis we mainly consider differential graded algebras $A$ with\ngraded-commutative cohomology ring. We show that a finitely presented graded\n$H^*A$-module $X$ is realisable if and only if its $\\mathfrak{p}$-localisation\n$X_{\\mathfrak{p}}$ is realisable for all graded prime ideals $\\mathfrak{p}$ of\n$H^*A$.\n  In order to obtain such a local-global principle also for the global\nobstruction, we define the \\emph{localisation of a differential graded algebra\n$A$ at a graded prime $\\mathfrak{p}$ of $H^*A$}, denoted by $A_{\\mathfrak{p}}$,\nand show the existence of a morphism of differential graded algebras inducing\nthe canonical map $H^*A \\to (H^*A)_{\\mathfrak{p}}$ in cohomology. The latter\nresult actually holds in a much more general setting: we prove that every\nsmashing localisation on the derived category of a differential graded algebra\nis induced by a morphism of differential graded algebras.\n  Finally we discuss the relation between realisability of modules over the\ngroup cohomology ring and the Tate cohomology ring.\n",

As one requires higher arithmetic levels in the degree of\nrandomness, one must make use of more iterates of the power set of the\ncontinuum to show that for all but countably many $x$'s there is a continuous\n$\\mu$ which makes $x$ random to that degree.\n",

The goal is to aid non-experts on Finsler spaces, but\nphysicists and geometers skilled in general relativity and particle theories,\nto understand the crucial importance of such geometric methods for applications\nin modern physics. We also would like to orient mathematicians working in\ngeneralized Finsler and Kahler geometry and geometric mechanics how they could\nperform their results in order to be accepted by the community ''orthodox''\nphysicists. Although the bulk of former models of Finsler-Lagrange spaces where\nelaborated on tangent bundles, the surprising result advocated in our works is\nthat such locally anisotropic structures can be modelled equivalently on\nRiemann-Cartan spaces, even as exact solutions in Einstein and/or string\ngravity, if nonholonomic distributions and moving frames of references are\nintroduced into consideration. We also propose a canonical scheme when\ngeometrical objects on a (pseudo) Riemannian space are nonholonomically\ndeformed into generalized Lagrange, or Finsler, configurations on the same\nmanifold or on a corresponding tangent bundle. Such canonical transforms are\ndefined by the coefficients of a prime metric (it can be a solution of the\nEinstein equations) and generate target spaces as generalized Lagrange\nstructures, their models of almost Hermitian/ Kahler, or nonholonomic Riemann\nspaces with constant curvature, for some Finsler like connections. There are\nformulated the criteria when such constructions can be redefined equivalently\nin terms of the Levi Civita connection.\n",

From this perspective, the most general logics are\nfuzzy logics, containing as special cases paraconsistent (quantum) logics,\nquantum logics, intuitionistic logics, and Boolean logics, each of which given\nby its own algebraic restrictions. New examples of a non-contradictory logic\nviolating the conjunctive De Morgan law, and of a typical non-orthomodular\nfuzzy logic along with its explicit lattice representation are given.\n",

The design and the error (between true and estimated state)\nequation are explicit and intrinsic. We consider also a particular case:\nleft-invariant systems on Lie groups with right equivariant output. The theory\nyields a class of observers such that error equation is autonomous. The\nobservers converge locally around any trajectory, and the global behavior is\nindependent from the trajectory, which reminds of the linear stationary case.\n",

A virtual class is constructed on the associated\nmoduli space by viewing a pair as an object in the derived category of $X$. The\nresulting invariants are conjecturally equivalent, after universal\ntransformations, to both the Gromov-Witten and DT theories of $X$. For\nCalabi-Yau 3-folds, the latter equivalence should be viewed as a wall-crossing\nformula in the derived category.\n  Several calculations of the new invariants are carried out. In the Fano case,\nthe local contributions of nonsingular embedded curves are found. In the local\ntoric Calabi-Yau case, a completely new form of the topological vertex is\ndescribed.\n  The virtual enumeration of pairs is closely related to the geometry\nunderlying the BPS state counts of Gopakumar and Vafa. We prove that our\nintegrality predictions for Gromov-Witten invariants agree with the BPS\nintegrality. Conversely, the BPS geometry imposes strong conditions on the\nenumeration of pairs.\n",

Assume G is a group definable in a structure\nM. We define a structure M_0 consisting of M and X as two sorts, where X is an\naffine copy of G and in M_0 we have the structure of M and the action of G on\nX. We prove that the Lascar group of M_0 is a semi-direct product of the Lascar\ngroup of M and G/G_L. We discuss the relationship between G-compactness of M\nand M_0. This example may yield new examples of non-G-compact theories.\n",

We also show that after an\nappropriate change of the variables, similar to Getzler's change in the\nequivariant Gromov-Witten theory of $\\CP^1$, the HQE turn into the HQE of the\n2-Toda hierarchy, i.e., the Gromov-Witten potential of $\\CP^1_{k,m}$ is a\ntau-function of the 2-Toda hierarchy. More precisely, we obtain a sequence of\ntau-functions of the 2-Toda hierarchy from the descendent potential via some\ntranslations. The later condition, that all tau-functions in the sequence are\nobtained from a single one via translations, imposes a serious constraint on\nthe solution of the 2-Toda hierarchy. Our theorem leads to the discovery of a\nnew integrable hierarchy (we suggest to be called the Equivariant Bi-graded\nToda Hierarchy). We conjecture that this new hierarchy governs, i.e., uniquely\ndetermines, the equivariant Gromov-Witten invariants of $\\CP^1_{k,m}.$\n",

Kuranishi structures occur naturally on moduli spaces of\nJ-holomorphic curves in symplectic geometry.\n  Let Y be an orbifold and R a commutative ring or Q-algebra. We define two\nkinds of Kuranishi homology KH_*(Y;R).

Our main result is that these are isomorphic to singular\nhomology. We define Poincare dual Kuranishi cohomology, isomorphic to\ncompactly-supported cohomology.\n  We define five kinds of Kuranishi (co)bordism spanned by isomorphism\nclasses[X,f] for X a compact oriented Kuranishi space without boundary and f :\nX --> Y smooth. They are new topological invariants, and we show they are very\nlarge. These theories are powerful new tools in symplectic geometry.

Reduction of\nnonlinear systems is typically performed in an exact manner - as is the case\nwith mechanical systems with symmetry--which, unfortunately, limits the type of\nsystems to which it can be applied. The goal of this paper is to consider a\nmore general form of reduction, termed approximate reduction, in order to\nextend the class of systems that can be reduced. Using notions related to\nincremental stability, we give conditions on when a dynamical system can be\nprojected to a lower dimensional space while providing hard bounds on the\ninduced errors, i.e., when it is behaviorally similar to a dynamical system on\na lower dimensional space. These concepts are illustrated on a series of\nexamples.\n",

In general, more\nagents are beneficial only if noisy agent dynamics and/or imperfect\nmeasurements are considered. The critical value of the risk sensitivity\nparameter above which the cost becomes infinite increases with the number of\nagents. In other words, for a fixed positive value of this parameter, there is\na minimum number of agents above which the cost remains finite.\n",

        "abstract": "  We study reduced-order models of three-dimensional perturbations in\nlinearized channel flow using balanced proper orthogonal decomposition (BPOD).\nThe models are obtained from three-dimensional simulations in physical space as\nopposed to the traditional single-wavenumber approach, and are therefore better\nable to capture the effects of localized disturbances or localized actuators.\nIn order to assess the performance of the models, we consider the impulse\nresponse and frequency response, and variation of the Reynolds number as a\nmodel parameter. We show that the BPOD procedure yields models that capture the\ntransient growth well at a low order, whereas standard POD does not capture the\ngrowth unless a considerably larger number of modes is included, and even then\ncan be inaccurate. In the case of a localized actuator, we show that POD modes\nwhich are not energetically significant can be very important for capturing the\nenergy growth. In addition, a comparison of the subspaces resulting from the\ntwo methods suggests that the use of a non-orthogonal projection with adjoint\nmodes is most likely the main reason for the superior performance of BPOD. We\nalso demonstrate that for single-wavenumber perturbations, low-order BPOD\nmodels reproduce the dominant eigenvalues of the full system better than POD\nmodels of the same order. These features indicate that the simple, yet accurate\nBPOD models are a good candidate for developing model-based controllers for\nchannel flow.\n",

        "abstract": "  Symbolic models are abstract descriptions of continuous systems in which\nsymbols represent aggregates of continuous states. In the last few years there\nhas been a growing interest in the use of symbolic models as a tool for\nmitigating complexity in control design. In fact, symbolic models enable the\nuse of well known algorithms in the context of supervisory control and\nalgorithmic game theory, for controller synthesis. Since the 1990's many\nresearchers faced the problem of identifying classes of dynamical and control\nsystems that admit symbolic models. In this paper we make a further progress\nalong this research line by focusing on control systems affected by\ndisturbances. Our main contribution is to show that incrementally globally\nasymptotically stable nonlinear control systems with disturbances admit\nsymbolic models. When specializing these results to linear systems, we show\nthat these symbolic models can be easily constructed.\n",

        "abstract": "  In 1955 George Mackey suggested that there is a fundamental dichotomy in the\nunitary representation theory of locally compact second countable groups. He\nfelt that there cannnot be a reasonable classification theory for the unitary\nrepresentations of a group G for which the dual is a non-smooth Borel space.\nMackey's precise conjecture regarding when this is the case was subsequently\nverified by Glimm. This approach to \"classifiability\" can be applied in many\nother branches of mathematics. Included in this article is a sketch of some of\nthe exciting new developments that have been made in this direction. Evidence\nis given that there should be extensions of Mackey's ideas to such \"finitistic\"\nproblems as the classification of the finite p-groups. In a different\ndirection, Mackey's thoughts about quantization are also briefly discussed.\n",

Requiring the total \\Delta operator to be nilpotent leads to a\ndifferential condition for \\nu, which is integrable. It turns out that the odd\nfunction \\nu is not an independent geometric object, but is instead completely\nspecified by the antisymplectic structure E and the density \\rho. The main\nimpact of introducing the \\nu term is that it makes compatibility relations\nbetween E and \\rho obsolete. We give a geometric interpretation of \\nu as\n(minus 1/8 times) the odd scalar curvature of an arbitrary antisymplectic,\ntorsion-free and \\rho-compatible connection. We show that the total \\Delta\noperator is a \\rho-dressed version of Khudaverdian's \\Delta_E operator, which\ntakes semidensities to semidensities. We also show that the construction\ngeneralizes to the situation where \\rho is replaced by a non-flat line bundle\nconnection F. This generalization is implemented by breaking the nilpotency of\n\\Delta with an arbitrary Grassmann-even second-order operator source.\n",

This invariant provides an upper bound for\nthe Thurston-Bennequin plus rotation number of any Legendrian realization of\nthe knot. We use it to demonstrate the first systematic construction of prime\nknots in contact manifolds other than the three-sphere with negative maximal\nThurston-Bennequin invariant. Perhaps more interesting, our invariant provides\na criterion for an open book to induce a tight contact structure. A corollary\nis that if a manifold possesses contact structures with distinct non-vanishing\nOzsvath-Szabo invariants, then any fibered knot can realize the classical\nEliashberg-Bennequin bound in at most one of these contact structures.\n",

Let C(L,g) denote the connected component\nof g in this poset. Our main result states that C(L,g) is a semidistributive\nlattice if L is semidistributive, and that C(L,g) is a bounded lattice if L is\nbounded. Let S_n be the permutohedron on n letters and T_n be the associahedron\non n+1 letters. Explicit computations show that C(S_n,a) = S_{n-1} and C(T_n,a)\n= T_{n-1}, up to isomorphism, whenever a is an atom. These results are\nconsequences of new characterizations of finite join semidistributive and\nfinite lower bounded lattices: (i) a finite lattice is join semidistributive if\nand only if the projection sending g in C(L) to g_0 in L creates pullbacks,\n(ii) a finite join semidistributive lattice is lower bounded if and only if it\nhas a strict facet labelling.

It is well known (see e.g.\nKie{\\l}pi\\'nski & Simson [5], Theorem 2.2) that the latter condition implies\nthat the (left) pure global dimension of $R$ is at most 1.

There\nare a number of special results regarding this question and this note is meant\nto be an addition to and a generalization of the set of these results. Whether\nthe module in the title is algebraically compact or not depends on the numbers\nof algebraically compact and non-compact modules among the components $M_\\al$.\n",

We note that flabby implies semi-flabby implies\nsurjective implies Mittag-Leffler. Some of the results about surjective inverse\nsystems have been known for some time. The aim of this note is to give a series\nof equivalent statements and implications involving surjective inverse systems\nand the systems satisfying the Mittag-Leffler condition, together with\nimprovements of established results, as well as their relationships with the\nalready known, but scattered facts. The most prominent results relate\ncardinalities of the index sets with right exactness of the inverse limit\nfunctor and the non-vanishing of the inverse limit -- connections related to\ncohomological dimensions.\n",

We study simple\nmanipulations of atomic flows that correspond to complex reductions on\nderivations. This allows us to prove, for propositional logic, a new and very\ngeneral normalisation theorem, which contains cut elimination as a special\ncase. We operate in deep inference, which is more general than other syntactic\nparadigms, and where normalisation is more difficult to control. We argue that\natomic flows are a significant technical advance for normalisation theory,\nbecause 1) the technique they support is largely independent of syntax; 2)\nindeed, it is largely independent of logical inference rules; 3) they\nconstitute a powerful geometric formalism, which is more intuitive than syntax.\n",

        "abstract": "  Cirquent calculus is a new proof-theoretic and semantic framework, whose main\ndistinguishing feature is being based on circuits, as opposed to the more\ntraditional approaches that deal with tree-like objects such as formulas or\nsequents. Among its advantages are greater efficiency, flexibility and\nexpressiveness. This paper presents a detailed elaboration of a deep-inference\ncirquent logic, which is naturally and inherently resource conscious. It shows\nthat classical logic, both syntactically and semantically, is just a special,\nconservative fragment of this more general and, in a sense, more basic logic --\nthe logic of resources in the form of cirquent calculus. The reader will find\nvarious arguments in favor of switching to the new framework, such as arguments\nshowing the insufficiency of the expressive power of linear logic or other\nformula-based approaches to developing resource logics, exponential\nimprovements over the traditional approaches in both representational and proof\ncomplexities offered by cirquent calculus, and more. Among the main purposes of\nthis paper is to provide an introductory-style starting point for what, as the\nauthor wishes to hope, might have a chance to become a new line of research in\nproof theory -- a proof theory based on circuits instead of formulas.\n",
