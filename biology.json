These knots\nare extremely rare, but their occurrence is likely connected to protein\nfunction in as yet unexplored fashion. Our analysis of the complete Protein\nData Bank reveals several new knots which, along with previously discovered\nones, can shed light on such connections. In particular, we identify the most\ncomplex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest that\nits entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by the\nproteasome. Knots in proteins are typically preserved across species and\nsometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which only\nappears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins of\nsimilar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in the\nenzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of a\nshort DNA fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into a\nknotted structure in this protein.\n",

Traditional\nstudies encounter problems because it is difficult to describe life and\ncognition in terms of matter and energy, since their laws are valid only at the\nphysical scale. However, if matter and energy, as well as life and cognition,\nare described in terms of information, evolution can be described consistently\nas information becoming more complex.\n  The paper presents eight tentative laws of information, valid at multiple\nscales, which are generalizations of Darwinian, cybernetic, thermodynamic,\npsychological, philosophical, and complexity principles. These are further used\nto discuss the notions of life, cognition and their evolution.\n",

Based on that, the spatial plankton model is furtherly\ninvestigated by means of computer simulations and theoretical analysis in the\npresent paper when its parameters would be expected in the case of mixed\nTuring-Hopf bifurcation region. Our results show that the spiral waves exist in\nthat region and the spatiotemporal chaos emerge, which arise from the far-field\nbreakup of the spiral waves over large ranges of diffusion coefficients of\nphytoplankton and zooplankton. Moreover, the spatiotemporal chaos arising from\nthe far-field breakup of spiral waves does not gradually involve the whole\nspace within that region. Our results are confirmed by means of computation\nspectra and nonlinear bifurcation of wave trains.

        "abstract": "  Structure entails function and thus a structural description of the brain\nwill help to understand its function and may provide insights into many\nproperties of brain systems, from their robustness and recovery from damage, to\ntheir dynamics and even their evolution. Advances in the analysis of complex\nnetworks provide useful new approaches to understanding structural and\nfunctional properties of brain networks. Structural properties of networks\nrecently described allow their characterization as small-world, random\n(exponential) and scale-free. They complement the set of other properties that\nhave been explored in the context of brain connectivity, such as topology,\nhodology, clustering, and hierarchical organization. Here we apply new network\nanalysis methods to cortical inter-areal connectivity networks for the cat and\nmacaque brains. We compare these corticocortical fibre networks to benchmark\nrewired, small-world, scale-free and random networks, using two analysis\nstrategies, in which we measure the effects of the removal of nodes and\nconnections on the structural properties of the cortical networks. The brain\nnetworks' structural decay is in most respects similar to that of scale-free\nnetworks. The results implicate highly connected hub-nodes and bottleneck\nconnections as structural basis for some of the conditional robustness of brain\nsystems. This informs the understanding of the development of brain networks'\nconnectivity.\n",

In this paper we\ndemonstrate the method on the 50-atom dileucine peptide, showing that\nequilibrium distributions are attained for manageable cooling schedules. For\nthis system, as naively implemented here, the method is modestly more efficient\nthan constant temperature simulation. However, the method is worth considering\nwhenever any simulated heating or cooling is performed (as is often done at the\nbeginning of a simulation project, or during an NMR structure calculation), as\nit is simple to implement and requires minimal additional CPU expense.\nFurthermore, the naive implementation presented here can be improved.\n",

Furthermore their evolution is\nconditioned by deterministic laws which often are not correlated with the\nstructural parameters and the global status of the network, as it should happen\nin a real biological system. In nature the environmental inputs are noise\naffected and fuzzy. Which thing sets the problem to investigate the possibility\nof emergent behaviour in a not strictly constrained net and subjected to\ndifferent inputs. It is here presented a new model of Evolutionary Neural Gas\n(ENG) with any topological constraints, trained by probabilistic laws depending\non the local distortion errors and the network dimension. The network is\nconsidered as a population of nodes that coexist in an ecosystem sharing local\nand global resources. Those particular features allow the network to quickly\nadapt to the environment, according to its dimensions. The ENG model analysis\nshows that the net evolves as a scale-free graph, and justifies in a deeply\nphysical sense- the term gas here used.\n",

        "abstract": "  In this paper a theoretical model of functioning of a neural circuit during a\nbehavioral response has been proposed. A neural circuit can be thought of as a\ndirected multigraph whose each vertex is a neuron and each edge is a synapse.\nIt has been assumed in this paper that the behavior of such circuits is\nmanifested through the collective behavior of neurons belonging to that\ncircuit. Behavioral information of each neuron is contained in the coefficients\nof the fast Fourier transform (FFT) over the output spike train. Those\ncoefficients form a vector in a multidimensional vector space. Behavioral\ndynamics of a neuronal network in response to strong aversive stimuli has been\nstudied in a vector space in which a suitable pseudometric has been defined.\nThe neurodynamical model of network behavior has been formulated in terms of\nexisting memory, synaptic plasticity and feelings. The model has an analogy in\nclassical electrostatics, by which the notion of force and potential energy has\nbeen introduced. Since the model takes input from each neuron in a network and\nproduces a behavior as the output, it would be extremely difficult or may even\nbe impossible to implement. But with the help of the model a possible\nexplanation for an hitherto unexplained neurological observation in human brain\nhas been offered. The model is compatible with a recent model of sequential\nbehavioral dynamics. The model is based on electrophysiology, but its relevance\nto hemodynamics has been outlined.\n",

Unlike most forms of\nstochastic resonance, the output response to suprathreshold random input\nsignals of arbitrary magnitude is improved by the presence of even small\namounts of noise. In this paper the information transmission performance of SSR\nin the limit of a large array size is considered. Using a relationship between\nShannon's mutual information and Fisher information, a sufficient condition for\noptimality, i.e. channel capacity, is derived. It is shown that capacity is\nachieved when the signal distribution is Jeffrey's prior, as formed from the\nnoise distribution, or when the noise distribution depends on the signal\ndistribution via a cosine relationship. These results provide theoretical\nverification and justification for previous work in both computational\nneuroscience and electronics.\n",

Using a simple theoretical model, we\nshow that the rate of such transitions is drastically enhanced if the lever is\nbendable, e.g. at a localized \"hinge''. Surprisingly, the transition is fastest\nwith an intermediate flexibility of the hinge. In this intermediate regime, the\ntransition rate is also least sensitive to the amount of \"cargo'' attached to\nthe lever arm, which could be exploited by molecular motors. To explain this\neffect, we generalize the Kramers-Langer theory for multi-dimensional barrier\ncrossing to configuration dependent mobility matrices.\n",

In contrast to\nbiochemical approaches, this method allows to determine simultaneously the DNA\ncomplexed length distribution and nucleosome position in various contexts.\nFirst, we show that differences in the nucleo-proteic structure observed\nbetween conventional H2A and H2A.Bbd variant nucleosomes induce quantitative\nchanges in the in the length distribution of DNA complexed with histones. Then,\nthe sliding action of remodeling complex SWI/SNF is characterized through the\nevolution of the nucleosome position and wrapped DNA length mapping. Using a\nlinear energetic model for the distribution of DNA complexed length, we extract\nthe net wrapping energy of DNA onto the histone octamer, and compare it to\nprevious studies.\n",

We provide instances that show that all the inclusions\nare strict. We extend the NP-completeness proof of recognizing 2-interval\ngraphs to the recognition of balanced 2-interval graphs.

For regulatory molecules (e.g., signaling proteins or\ntranscription factors), fluctuations in their expression can affect the levels\nof downstream targets in a network. Here, we develop an analytic framework to\ninvestigate the phenomenon of noise correlation in molecular networks.\nSpecifically, we focus on the metabolic network, which is highly inter-linked,\nand noise properties may constrain its structure and function. Motivated by the\nanalogy between the dynamics of a linear metabolic pathway and that of the\nexactly soluable linear queueing network or, alternatively, a mass transfer\nsystem, we derive a plethora of results concerning fluctuations in the\nabundance of intermediate metabolites in various common motifs of the metabolic\nnetwork. For all but one case examined, we find the steady-state fluctuation in\ndifferent nodes of the pathways to be effectively uncorrelated. Consequently,\nfluctuations in enzyme levels only affect local properties and do not propagate\nelsewhere into metabolic networks, and intermediate metabolites can be freely\nshared by different reactions. Our approach may be applicable to study\nmetabolic networks with more complex topologies, or protein signaling networks\nwhich are governed by similar biochemical reactions. Possible implications for\nbioinformatic analysis of metabolimic data are discussed.\n",

        "abstract": "  A practical introduction to stochastic modelling of reaction-diffusion\nprocesses is presented. No prior knowledge of stochastic simulations is\nassumed. The methods are explained using illustrative examples. The article\nstarts with the classical Gillespie algorithm for the stochastic modelling of\nchemical reactions. Then stochastic algorithms for modelling molecular\ndiffusion are given. Finally, basic stochastic reaction-diffusion methods are\npresented. The connections between stochastic simulations and deterministic\nmodels are explained and basic mathematical tools (e.g. chemical master\nequation) are presented. The article concludes with an overview of more\nadvanced methods and problems.\n",

The growth rate of each clonal\npopulation has been estimated by fitting experimental data with the logistic\nequation. Results: The growth rates were observed to vary among different\nclones.

Simulating the model in the computer,\nfaithfully reproduces the known sequence of regulatory activity patterns along\nthe cell cycle of the living cell. Contrary to existing differential equation\nmodels, no parameters enter the model except the structure of the regulatory\ncircuitry. The dynamical properties of the model indicate that the biological\ndynamical sequence is robustly implemented in the regulatory network, with the\nbiological stationary state G1 corresponding to the dominant attractor in state\nspace, and with the biological regulatory sequence being a strongly attractive\ntrajectory. Comparing the fission yeast cell-cycle model to a similar model of\nthe corresponding network in S. cerevisiae, a remarkable difference in\ncircuitry, as well as dynamics is observed. While the latter operates in a\nstrongly damped mode, driven by external excitation, the S. pombe network\nrepresents an auto-excited system with external damping.\n",

The performance of phylogenetic reconstruction methods where\nthe underlying data is generated by a mixture model has stimulated considerable\nrecent debate. Much of the controversy stems from simulations of mixture model\ndata on a given tree topology for which reconstruction algorithms output a tree\nof a different topology; these findings were held up to show the shortcomings\nof particular tree reconstruction methods. In so doing, the underlying\nassumption was that mixture model data on one topology can be distinguished\nfrom data evolved on an unmixed tree of another topology given enough data and\nthe ``correct'' method. Here we show that this assumption can be false. For\nbiologists our results imply that, for example, the combined data from two\ngenes whose phylogenetic trees differ only in terms of branch lengths can\nperfectly fit a tree of a different topology.\n",

        "abstract": "  In this paper, we propose a novel inference method for dynamic genetic\nnetworks which makes it possible to face with a number of time measurements n\nmuch smaller than the number of genes p. The approach is based on the concept\nof low order conditional dependence graph that we extend here in the case of\nDynamic Bayesian Networks. Most of our results are based on the theory of\ngraphical models associated with the Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). In this\nway, we define a minimal DAG G which describes exactly the full order\nconditional dependencies given the past of the process. Then, to face with the\nlarge p and small n estimation case, we propose to approximate DAG G by\nconsidering low order conditional independencies. We introduce partial qth\norder conditional dependence DAGs G(q) and analyze their probabilistic\nproperties. In general, DAGs G(q) differ from DAG G but still reflect relevant\ndependence facts for sparse networks such as genetic networks. By using this\napproximation, we set out a non-bayesian inference method and demonstrate the\neffectiveness of this approach on both simulated and real data analysis. The\ninference procedure is implemented in the R package 'G1DBN' freely available\nfrom the CRAN archive.\n",

Our\napproach considers all possible scenarios for the set of species that will be\nextant at some future time, and weights them according to their likelihood\nunder an independent (but not identical) distribution on species extinctions.\nAlthough the number of extinction scenarios can typically be very large, we\nshow that there is a simple algorithm that will quickly compute this index. The\nmethod is implemented and applied to the prosimian primates as a test case, and\nthe associated species ranking is compared to a related measure (the `Shapley\nindex').

We re-examine the evidence for a 62\nmillion year (Myr) periodicity in biodiversity throughout the Phanerozoic\nhistory of animal life reported by Rohde & Mueller (2005), as well as related\nquestions of periodicity in origination and extinction. We find that the signal\nis robust against variations in methods of analysis, and is based on\nfluctuations in the Paleozoic and a substantial part of the Mesozoic.\nExamination of origination and extinction is somewhat ambiguous, with results\ndepending upon procedure. Origination and extinction intensity as defined by RM\nmay be affected by an artifact at 27 Myr in the duration of stratigraphic\nintervals. Nevertheless, when a procedure free of this artifact is implemented,\nthe 27 Myr periodicity appears in origination, suggesting that the artifact may\nultimately be based on a signal in the data. A 62 Myr feature appears in\nextinction, when this same procedure is used. We conclude that evidence for a\nperiodicity at 62 Myr is robust, and evidence for periodicity at approximately\n27 Myr is also present, albeit more ambiguous.\n",

        "abstract": "  A fundamental problem in neuroscience is understanding how working memory --\nthe ability to store information at intermediate timescales, like 10s of\nseconds -- is implemented in realistic neuronal networks. The most likely\ncandidate mechanism is the attractor network, and a great deal of effort has\ngone toward investigating it theoretically. Yet, despite almost a quarter\ncentury of intense work, attractor networks are not fully understood. In\nparticular, there are still two unanswered questions. First, how is it that\nattractor networks exhibit irregular firing, as is observed experimentally\nduring working memory tasks? And second, how many memories can be stored under\nbiologically realistic conditions? Here we answer both questions by studying an\nattractor neural network in which inhibition and excitation balance each other.\nUsing mean field analysis, we derive a three-variable description of attractor\nnetworks. From this description it follows that irregular firing can exist only\nif the number of neurons involved in a memory is large. The same mean field\nanalysis also shows that the number of memories that can be stored in a network\nscales with the number of excitatory connections, a result that has been\nsuggested for simple models but never shown for realistic ones. Both of these\npredictions are verified using simulations with large networks of spiking\nneurons.\n",

        "abstract": "  In most vertebrate species, the body axis is generated by the formation of\nrepeated transient structures called somites. This spatial periodicity in\nsomitogenesis has been related to the temporally sustained oscillations in\ncertain mRNAs and their associated gene products in the cells forming the\npresomatic mesoderm. The mechanism underlying these oscillations have been\nidentified as due to the delays involved in the synthesis of mRNA and\ntranslation into protein molecules [J. Lewis, Current Biol. {\\bf 13}, 1398\n(2003)]. In addition, in the zebrafish embryo intercellular Notch signalling\ncouples these oscillators and a longitudinal positional information signal in\nthe form of an Fgf8 gradient exists that could be used to transform these\ncoupled temporal oscillations into the observed spatial periodicity of somites.\nHere we consider a simple model based on this known biology and study its\nconsequences for somitogenesis. Comparison is made with the known properties of\nsomite formation in the zebrafish embryo . We also study the effects of\nlocalized Fgf8 perturbations on somite patterning.\n",

        "abstract": "  An epidemic multi-strain model with temporary cross-immunity shows chaos,\neven in a previously unexpected parameter region. Especially dengue fever\nmodels with strong enhanced infectivity on secondary infection have previously\nshown deterministic chaos motivated by experimental findings of\nantibody-dependent-enhancement (ADE). Including temporary cross-immunity in\nsuch models, which is common knowledge among field researchers in dengue, we\nfind a deterministically chaotic attractor in the more realistic parameter\nregion of reduced infectivity on secondary infection (''inverse ADE'' parameter\nregion). This is realistic for dengue fever since on second infection people\nare more likely to be hospitalized, hence do not contribute to the force of\ninfection as much as people with first infection.\n  Our finding has wider implications beyond dengue in any multi-strain\nepidemiological systems with altered infectivity upon secondary infection,\nsince we can relax the condition of rather high infectivity on secondary\ninfection previously required for deterministic chaos. For dengue the finding\nof wide ranges of chaotic attractors open new ways to analysis of existing data\nsets.\n",

        "abstract": "  RNA motifs typically consist of short, modular patterns that include base\npairs formed within and between modules. Estimating the abundance of these\npatterns is of fundamental importance for assessing the statistical\nsignificance of matches in genomewide searches, and for predicting whether a\ngiven function has evolved many times in different species or arose from a\nsingle common ancestor. In this manuscript, we review in an integrated and\nself-contained manner some basic concepts of automata theory, generating\nfunctions and transfer matrix methods that are relevant to pattern analysis in\nbiological sequences. We formalize, in a general framework, the concept of\nMarkov chain embedding to analyze patterns in random strings produced by a\nmemoryless source. This conceptualization, together with the capability of\nautomata to recognize complicated patterns, allows a systematic analysis of\nproblems related to the occurrence and frequency of patterns in random strings.\nThe applications we present focus on the concept of synchronization of\nautomata, as well as automata used to search for a finite number of keywords\n(including sets of patterns generated according to base pairing rules) in a\ngeneral text.\n",

        "abstract": "  The time-dependent transverse response of stiff polymers, represented as\nweakly-bending wormlike chains (WLCs), is well-understood on the linear level,\nwhere transverse degrees of freedom evolve independently from the longitudinal\nones. We show that, beyond a characteristic time scale, the nonlinear coupling\nof transverse and longitudinal motion in an inextensible WLC significantly\nweakens the polymer response compared to the widely used linear response\npredictions. The corresponding feedback mechanism is rationalized by scaling\narguments and quantified by a multiple scale approach that exploits an inherent\nseparation of transverse and longitudinal correlation length scales. Crossover\nscaling laws and exact analytical and numerical solutions for characteristic\nresponse quantities are derived for different experimentally relevant setups.\nOur findings are applicable to cytoskeletal filaments as well as DNA under\ntension.\n",

In peripheral nerve, matrix\nmetalloproteinase (MMP) creates a 30 kDa fragment of beta-dystroglycan, leading\nto a disruption of the link between the extracellular matrix and the cell\nmembrane. Here we asked if the processing of the beta-dystroglycan could\ninfluence the anchorage of Dp116 or/and utrophin in normal and mdx Schwann cell\nmembrane. We showed that MMP-9 was more activated in mdx nerve than in\nwild-type one. This activation leads to an accumulation of the 30 kDa\nbeta-dystroglycan isoform and have an impact on the anchorage of Dp116 and\nutrophin isoforms in mdx Schwann cells membrane. Our results showed that Dp116\nhad greater affinity to the full length form of beta-dystroglycan than the 30\nkDa form. Moreover, we showed for the first time that the short isoform of\nutrophin (Up71) was over-expressed in mdx Schwann cells compared to wild-type.\nIn addition, this utrophin isoform (Up71) seems to have greater affinity to the\n30 kDa beta-dystroglycan which could explain a more stabilization of this 30\nkDa at the membrane compartment. Our results highlight the potential\nparticipation of the short utrophin isoform and the cleaved form of\nbeta-dystroglycan in mdx Schwann cell membrane architecture.\n",

        "abstract": "  How can a microorganism adapt to a variety of environmental conditions\ndespite there exists a limited number of signal transduction machineries? We\nshow that for any growing cells whose gene expression is under stochastic\nfluctuations, adaptive cellular state is inevitably selected by noise, even\nwithout specific signal transduction network for it. In general, changes in\nprotein concentration in a cell are given by its synthesis minus dilution and\ndegradation, both of which are proportional to the rate of cell growth. In an\nadaptive state with a higher growth speed, both terms are large and balanced.\nUnder the presence of noise in gene expression, the adaptive state is less\naffected by stochasticity since both the synthesis and dilution terms are\nlarge, while for a non-adaptive state both the terms are smaller so that cells\nare easily kicked out of the original state by noise. Hence, escape time from a\ncellular state and the cellular growth rate are negatively correlated. This\nleads to a selection of adaptive states with higher growth rates, and model\nsimulations confirm this selection to take place in general. The results\nsuggest a general form of adaptation that has never been brought to light - a\nprocess that requires no specific machineries for sensory adaptation. The\npresent scheme may help explain a wide range of cellular adaptive responses\nincluding the metabolic flux optimization for maximal cell growth.\n",

An innovative health strategy is being developed through the use of\ncomputer and sensory substitution via the tongue in order to compensate for the\nsensory loss in the buttock area for individuals with paraplegia. This sensory\ncompensation will enable individuals with spinal cord injuries to be aware of a\nlocalized excess of pressure at the skin/seat interface and, consequently, will\nenable them to prevent the formation of pressure ulcers by relieving the\ncutaneous area of suffering. This work reports an initial evaluation of this\napproach and the feasibility of creating an adapted behavior, with a change in\npressure as a response to electro-stimulated information on the tongue.\nObtained during a clinical study in 10 healthy seated subjects, the first\nresults are encouraging, with 92% success in 100 performed tests. These\nresults, which have to be completed and validated in the paraplegic population,\nmay lead to a new approach to education in health to prevent the formation of\npressure ulcers within this population.

Whereas parallel update schemes have been studied extensively in past\nyears, the level of understanding of asynchronous updates schemes is still very\npoor. In this paper we study the propagation of external information given by\nregulatory input variables into a random Boolean network. We compute both\nanalytically and numerically the time evolution and the asymptotic behavior of\nthis propagation of external regulation (PER). In particular, this allows us to\nidentify variables which are completely determined by this external\ninformation. All those variables in the network which are not directly fixed by\nPER form a core which contains in particular all non-trivial feedback loops. We\ndesign a message-passing approach allowing to characterize the statistical\nproperties of these cores in dependence of the Boolean network and the external\ncondition. At the end we establish a link between PER dynamics and the full\nrandom asynchronous dynamics of a Boolean network.\n",

This problem of static classification models is addressed in this\npaper by the introduction of incremental learning for problems in\nbioinformatics. Many machine learning tools have been applied to this problem\nusing static machine learning structures such as neural networks or support\nvector machines that are unable to accommodate new information into their\nexisting models. We utilize the fuzzy ARTMAP as an alternate machine learning\nsystem that has the ability of incrementally learning new data as it becomes\navailable. The fuzzy ARTMAP is found to be comparable to many of the widespread\nmachine learning systems. The use of an evolutionary strategy in the selection\nand combination of individual classifiers into an ensemble system, coupled with\nthe incremental learning ability of the fuzzy ARTMAP is proven to be suitable\nas a pattern classifier. The algorithm presented is tested using data from the\nG-Coupled Protein Receptors Database and shows good accuracy of 83%. The system\npresented is also generally applicable, and can be used in problems in genomics\nand proteomics.\n",

In this study we\npresent a computational reconstruction approach to the problem of network\norganization, by considering the topological and spatial features of each area\nin the primate cerebral cortex as subsidy for the reconstruction of the global\ncortical network connectivity. Starting with all areas being disconnected,\npairs of areas with similar sets of features are linked together, in an attempt\nto recover the original network structure. Inferring primate cortical\nconnectivity from the properties of the nodes, remarkably good reconstructions\nof the global network organization could be obtained, with the topological\nfeatures allowing slightly superior accuracy to the spatial ones. Analogous\nreconstruction attempts for the C. elegans neuronal network resulted in\nsubstantially poorer recovery, indicating that cortical area interconnections\nare relatively stronger related to the considered topological and spatial\nproperties than neuronal projections in the nematode. The close relationship\nbetween area-based features and global connectivity may hint on developmental\nrules and constraints for cortical networks. Particularly, differences between\nthe predictions from topological and spatial properties, together with the\npoorer recovery resulting from spatial properties, indicate that the\norganization of cortical networks is not entirely determined by spatial\nconstraints.\n",

Measuring the local concentration of such a\nprotein with a spatially-varying distribution allows the measurement of\nposition within the system. In order for these systems to work effectively,\nposition determination must be robust to noise. Here, we calculate fundamental\nlimits to the precision of position determination by concentration gradients\ndue to unavoidable biochemical noise perturbing the gradients. We focus on\ngradient proteins with first order reaction kinetics. Systems of this type have\nbeen experimentally characterised in both developmental and cell biology\nsettings. For a single gradient we show that, through time-averaging, great\nprecision can potentially be achieved even with very low protein copy numbers.\nAs a second example, we investigate the ability of a system with oppositely\ndirected gradients to find its centre. With this mechanism, positional\nprecision close to the centre improves more slowly with increasing averaging\ntime, and so longer averaging times or higher copy numbers are required for\nhigh precision. For both single and double gradients, we demonstrate the\nexistence of optimal length scales for the gradients, where precision is\nmaximized, as well as analyzing how precision depends on the size of the\nconcentration measuring apparatus. Our results provide fundamental constraints\non the positional precision supplied by concentration gradients in various\ncontexts, including both in developmental biology and also within a single\ncell.\n",

The processes--$\\epsilon$-machines as defined in\ncomputational mechanics--and their interaction networks both provide well\ndefined notions of structure. This enables us to quantitatively demonstrate\nhierarchical self-organization in the soup in terms of complexity. We found\nthat replicating processes evolve the strategy of successively building higher\nlevels of organization by autocatalysis. Moreover, this is facilitated by local\ncomponents that have low structural complexity, but high generality. In effect,\nthe finitary process soup spontaneously evolves a selection pressure that\nfavors such components. In light of the finitary process soup's generality,\nthese results suggest a fundamental law of hierarchical systems: global\ncomplexity requires local simplicity.\n",

        "abstract": "  A general and basic model of primordial evolution--a soup of reacting\nfinitary and discrete processes--is employed to identify and analyze\nfundamental mechanisms that generate and maintain complex structures in\nprebiotic systems. The processes--$\\epsilon$-machines as defined in\ncomputational mechanics--and their interaction networks both provide well\ndefined notions of structure. This enables us to quantitatively demonstrate\nhierarchical self-organization in the soup in terms of complexity. We found\nthat replicating processes evolve the strategy of successively building higher\nlevels of organization by autocatalysis. Moreover, this is facilitated by local\ncomponents that have low structural complexity, but high generality. In effect,\nthe finitary process soup spontaneously evolves a selection pressure that\nfavors such components. In light of the finitary process soup's generality,\nthese results suggest a fundamental law of hierarchical systems: global\ncomplexity requires local simplicity.\n",

The computed distributions remarkably agree with the\nworm-like chain theory for double helices of one helical turn and longer, and\nqualitatively differ from predictions of the semi-elastic chain model. The\ncomputed data exhibit only small anomalies in the apparent flexibility of short\nDNA and cannot account for the recently reported AFM data (Wiggins et al,\nNature nanotechnology 1, 137 (2006)). It is possible that the current atomistic\nDNA models miss some essential mechanisms of DNA bending on intermediate length\nscales. Analysis of bent DNA structures reveals, however, that the bending\nmotion is structurally heterogeneous and directionally anisotropic on the\nintermediate length scales where the experimental anomalies were detected.\nThese effects are essential for interpretation of the experimental data and\nthey also can be responsible for the apparent discrepancy.\n",

        "abstract": "  BACKGROUND: Many of the mutations accumulated by naturally evolving proteins\nare neutral in the sense that they do not significantly alter a protein's\nability to perform its primary biological function. However, new protein\nfunctions evolve when selection begins to favor other, \"promiscuous\" functions\nthat are incidental to a protein's biological role.

This parameter-free prediction is in good agreement\nwith recent experiments on the Bicoid/Hunchback system in the early Drosophila\nembryo, and this system achieves ~90% of its theoretical maximum information\ntransmission.\n",

        "abstract": "  Previously, we have identified the cytoplasmic zinc metalloprotease\ninsulin-degrading enzyme(IDE) in human tissues by an immunohistochemical method\ninvolving no antigen retrieval (AR) by pressure cooking to avoid artifacts by\nendogenous biotin exposure and a detection kit based on the labeled\nstreptavidin biotin (LSAB) method. Thereby, we also employed 3% hydrogen\nperoxide(H2O2) for the inhibition of endogenous peroxidase activity and\nincubated the tissue sections with the biotinylated secondary antibody at room\ntemperature (RT). We now add the immunohistochemical details that had led us to\nthis optimized procedure as they also bear a more general relevance when\ndemonstrating intracellular tissue antigens. Our most important result is that\nendogenous peroxidase inhibition by 0.3% H2O2 coincided with an apparently\npositive IDE staining in an investigated breast cancer specimen whereas\ncombining a block by 3% H2O2 with an incubation of the biotinylated secondary\nantibody at RT, yet not at 37 degrees Celsius, revealed this specimen as almost\nentirely IDE-negative. Our present data caution against three different\nimmunohistochemical pitfalls that might cause falsely positive results and\nartifacts when using an LSAB- and peroxidase-based detection method: pressure\ncooking for AR, insufficient quenching of endogenous peroxidases and heating of\ntissue sections while incubating with biotinylated secondary antibodies.\n",

We find that this assumption is insufficient to model the\nexperimentally observed shapes and packing of the cells based on their cadherin\nexpression. We then consider a model in which adhesion leads to a surface\nincrease, balanced by cell cortex contraction. Using the experimentally\nobserved distributions of E- and N-cadherin, we simulate the packing and cell\nshapes in the wildtype eye. Furthermore, by changing only the corresponding\nparameters, this model can describe the mutants with different numbers of\ncells, or changes in cadherin expression.\n",

To assess the effect of\nthis biofeedback system on postural control during quiet standing, ten young\nhealthy adults were asked to stand as immobile as possible with their eyes\nclosed in two conditions of No-biofeedback and Biofeedback. Centre of foot\npressure (CoP) displacements were recorded using a force platform. Results\nshowed reduced CoP displacements in the Biofeedback relative to the\nNo-biofeedback condition. The present findings evidenced the ability of the\ncentral nervous system to efficiently integrate an artificial plantar-based,\ntongue-placed tactile biofeedback for controlling control posture during quiet\nstanding.\n",

The model describes a set of species subject to competitive\ninteractions through a background of resources, which they feed upon.\nAdditionally direct competitive or co-operative interaction between species may\noccur through a random coupling matrix. We compute the order parameters of the\nsystem in a fixed point regime, and identify the onset of instability and\ncompute the phase diagram. We focus on the effects of variability of resources,\ndirect interaction between species, co-operation pressure and dilution on the\nstability and the diversity of the ecosystem. It is shown that resources can be\nexploited optimally only in absence of co-operation pressure or direct\ninteraction between species.\n",

        "abstract": "  Biologists are leading current research on genome characterization\n(sequencing, alignment, transcription), providing a huge quantity of raw data\nabout many genome organisms. Extracting knowledge from this raw data is an\nimportant process for biologists, using usually data mining approaches.\nHowever, it is difficult to deals with these genomic information using actual\nbioinformatics data mining tools, because data are heterogeneous, huge in\nquantity and geographically distributed. In this paper, we present a new\napproach between data mining and virtual reality visualization, called visual\ndata mining. Indeed Virtual Reality becomes ripe, with efficient display\ndevices and intuitive interaction in an immersive context. Moreover, biologists\nuse to work with 3D representation of their molecules, but in a desktop\ncontext. We present a software solution, Genome3DExplorer, which addresses the\nproblem of genomic data visualization, of scene management and interaction.\nThis solution is based on a well-adapted graphical and interaction paradigm,\nwhere local and global topological characteristics of data are easily visible,\non the contrary to traditional genomic database browsers, always focused on the\nzoom and details level.\n",

Here we show that the space of shapes\nadopted by the nematode C. elegans is surprisingly low dimensional, with just\nfour dimensions accounting for 95% of the shape variance, and we partially\nreconstruct \"equations of motion\" for the dynamics in this space. These\ndynamics have multiple attractors, and we find that the worm visits these in a\nrapid and almost completely deterministic response to weak thermal stimuli.\nStimulus-dependent correlations among the different modes suggest that one can\ngenerate more reliable behaviors by synchronizing stimuli to the state of the\nworm in shape space. We confirm this prediction, effectively \"steering\" the\nworm in real time.\n",

A\nseries of two-dimensional swimming bodies employing a variety of propulsion\nmechanisms -- motivated by biological and microrobotic designs -- is\ninvestigated, including the use of moving limbs, changing body shapes and fluid\njets. The swimming efficiency and the nature of the induced, time-dependent\nflow fields are found to differ widely among body designs and propulsion\nmechanisms.\n",

        "abstract": "  The prediction of the three-dimensional native structure of proteins from the\nknowledge of their amino acid sequence, known as the protein folding problem,\nis one of the most important yet unsolved issues of modern science. Since the\nconformational behaviour of flexible molecules is nothing more than a complex\nphysical problem, increasingly more physicists are moving into the study of\nprotein systems, bringing with them powerful mathematical and computational\ntools, as well as the sharp intuition and deep images inherent to the physics\ndiscipline. This work attempts to facilitate the first steps of such a\ntransition. In order to achieve this goal, we provide an exhaustive account of\nthe reasons underlying the protein folding problem enormous relevance and\nsummarize the present-day status of the methods aimed to solving it. We also\nprovide an introduction to the particular structure of these biological\nheteropolymers, and we physically define the problem stating the assumptions\nbehind this (commonly implicit) definition. Finally, we review the 'special\nflavor' of statistical mechanics that is typically used to study the\nastronomically large phase spaces of macromolecules. Throughout the whole work,\nmuch material that is found scattered in the literature has been put together\nhere to improve comprehension and to serve as a handy reference.\n",

        "abstract": "  We report a first in modeling and simulation of the effects of the HIV\nproteins on the (caspase dependent) apoptotic pathway in infected cells. This\nwork is novel and is an extension on the recent reports and clarifications on\nthe FAS apoptotic pathway from the literature. We have gathered most of the\nreaction rates and initial conditions from the literature, the rest of the\nconstants have been computed by fitting our model to the experimental results\nreported. Using the model obtained we have then run the simulations for the\ninfected memory T cells, called also latent T cells, which, at the moment,\nrepresent the major obstacle to finding a cure for HIV. We can now report that\nthe infected latent T cells have an estimated lifetime of about 42 hours from\nthe moment they are re-activated. As far as we know this is the first result of\nthis type obtained for the infected memory T cells.\n",

This model takes into account the cylindrical shape of the histone\noctamers, the H1 histones in front of the nucleosomes and the vertical distance\n$d$ between the in and outgoing DNA strands. Factoring these chromatin features\nin, one gets essential changes in the chromatin phase diagram: Not only the\nshape of the excluded-volume borderline changes but also the vertical distance\n$d$ has a dramatic influence on the forbidden area. Furthermore, we examined\nthe influence of H1 defects on the properties of the chromatin fiber. Thus we\npresent two possible strategies for chromatin compaction: The use of very dense\nstates in the phase diagram in the gaps in the excluded volume borderline or\nmissing H1 histones which can lead to very compact fibers. The chromatin fiber\nmight use both of these mechanisms to compact itself at least locally. Line\ndensities computed within the model coincident with the experimental values.\n",

        "abstract": "  In this paper, we present a method to optimise rough set partition sizes, to\nwhich rule extraction is performed on HIV data. The genetic algorithm\noptimisation technique is used to determine the partition sizes of a rough set\nin order to maximise the rough sets prediction accuracy. The proposed method is\ntested on a set of demographic properties of individuals obtained from the\nSouth African antenatal survey. Six demographic variables were used in the\nanalysis, these variables are; race, age of mother, education, gravidity,\nparity, and age of father, with the outcome or decision being either HIV\npositive or negative. Rough set theory is chosen based on the fact that it is\neasy to interpret the extracted rules. The prediction accuracy of equal width\nbin partitioning is 57.7% while the accuracy achieved after optimising the\npartitions is 72.8%. Several other methods have been used to analyse the HIV\ndata and their results are stated and compared to that of rough set theory\n(RST).\n",

However how\nsynfire chains coexist in one network remains to be elucidated. We have studied\nthe activity of a layered associative network of Leaky Integrate-and-Fire\nneurons in which connection we embed memory patterns by the Hebbian Learning.\nWe analyzed their activity by the Fokker-Planck method. In our previous report,\nwhen a half of neurons belongs to each memory pattern (memory pattern rate\n$F=0.5$), the temporal profiles of the network activity is split into\ntemporally clustered groups called sublattices under certain input conditions.\nIn this study, we show that when the network is sparsely connected ($F<0.5$),\nsynchronous firings of the memory pattern are promoted. On the contrary, the\ndensely connected network ($F>0.5$) inhibit synchronous firings. The sparseness\nand denseness also effect the basin of attraction and the storage capacity of\nthe embedded memory patterns. We show that the sparsely(densely) connected\nnetworks enlarge(shrink) the basion of attraction and increase(decrease) the\nstorage capacity.\n",

In experimental realizations, when a leg\ndetaches from a segment of the surface for the first time it alters that\nsegment, and legs subsequently bound to these altered segments more weakly.\nInspired by these experiments we investigate spiders moving along a\none-dimensional substrate, whose legs leave newly visited sites at a slower\nrate than revisited sites. For a random walk (one-leg spider) the slowdown does\nnot effect the long time behavior. For a bipedal spider, however, the slowdown\ngenerates an effective bias towards unvisited sites, and the spider behaves\nsimilarly to the excited walk. Surprisingly, the slowing down of the spider at\nnew sites increases the diffusion coefficient and accelerates the growth of the\nnumber of visited sites.\n",

In this paper,\nGillespie's results are extended to population genetic systems with explicit\nage structure, where the demographic variance (variance in growth rate)\ncalculated in the work of Engen and colleagues is used as a generalization of\n\"variance in offspring number\" to predict the interaction between deterministic\nand random forces driving change in allele frequency. By calculating the\nvariance from the life history parameters, it is shown that selection against\nvariance in the growth rate will favor a genotypes with lower stochasticity in\nage specific survival and fertility rates. A diffusion approximation for\nselection and drift in a population with two genotypes with different life\nhistory matrices (and therefore, different growth rates and demographic\nvariances) is derived and shown to be consistent with individual based\nsimulations. It is also argued that for finite populations, perturbation\nanalyses of both the growth rate and demographic variances may be necessary to\ndetermine the sensitivity of \"fitness\" (broadly defined) to changes in the life\nhistory parameters.\n",

        "abstract": "  Motivation: Similarity-measure based clustering is a crucial problem\nappearing throughout scientific data analysis. Recently, a powerful new\nalgorithm called Affinity Propagation (AP) based on message-passing techniques\nwas proposed by Frey and Dueck \\cite{Frey07}. In AP, each cluster is identified\nby a common exemplar all other data points of the same cluster refer to, and\nexemplars have to refer to themselves. Albeit its proved power, AP in its\npresent form suffers from a number of drawbacks. The hard constraint of having\nexactly one exemplar per cluster restricts AP to classes of regularly shaped\nclusters, and leads to suboptimal performance, {\\it e.g.}, in analyzing gene\nexpression data. Results: This limitation can be overcome by relaxing the AP\nhard constraints. A new parameter controls the importance of the constraints\ncompared to the aim of maximizing the overall similarity, and allows to\ninterpolate between the simple case where each data point selects its closest\nneighbor as an exemplar and the original AP. The resulting soft-constraint\naffinity propagation (SCAP) becomes more informative, accurate and leads to\nmore stable clustering. Even though a new {\\it a priori} free-parameter is\nintroduced, the overall dependence of the algorithm on external tuning is\nreduced, as robustness is increased and an optimal strategy for parameter\nselection emerges more naturally. SCAP is tested on biological benchmark data,\nincluding in particular microarray data related to various cancer types. We\nshow that the algorithm efficiently unveils the hierarchical cluster structure\npresent in the data sets. Further on, it allows to extract sparse gene\nexpression signatures for each cluster.\n",

These two Eupelmidae\nhave similar activity rhythms. Displacements of these parasitoids essentially\ntake place during the photophase. But the activity of E. vuilleti is earlier,\nbecause the individuals of this species start their activity on average 4 to 5\nh earlier than those of E. orientalis. E. vuilleti begins its displacements\nseveral hours before the onset of lighting, whereas E. orientalis is active\nonly in the presence of the light.

        "abstract": "  There are many processes in biology in which mechanical forces are generated.\nForce-bearing networks can transduce locally developed mechanical signals very\nextensively over different parts of the cell or tissues. In this article we\nconduct an overview of this kind of mechanical transduction, focusing in\nparticular on the multiple layers of complexity displayed by the mechanisms\nthat control and trigger the conversion of a mechanical signal into a\nbiochemical function. Single molecule methodologies, through their capability\nto introduce the force in studies of biological processes in which mechanical\nstresses are developed, are unveiling subtle intertwining mechanisms between\nchemistry and mechanics and in particular are revealing how chemistry can\ncontrol mechanics. The possibility that chemistry interplays with mechanics\nshould be always considered in biochemical studies.\n",

        "abstract": "  In Chile and Uruguay,the gregarious Pteromalidae (Monoksa dorsiplana) has\nbeen discovered emerging from seeds of the persistent pods of Acacia caven\nattacked by the univoltin bruchid Pseudopachymeria spinipes. We investigated\nthe potential for mass rearing of this gregarious ectoparasitoid on an\nalternative bruchid host, Callosobruchus maculatus, to use it against the\nbruchidae of native and cultured species of Leguminosea seeds in South America.\nThe mass rearing of M.dorsiplana was carried out in a population cage where the\ndensity of egg-laying females per infested seed was increased from 1:1 on the\nfirst day to 5:1 on the last (fifth) day. Under these experimental conditions\negg-clutch size per host increased, and at the same time the mortality of eggs\nlaid also increased. The density of egg-laying females influenced the sex ratio\nwhich tended towards a balance of sons and daughters,in contrast to the sex\nratio of a single egg-laying female per host (1 son to 7 daughters). The mean\nweight of adults emerging from a parasitized host was negatively correlated\nwith the egg-clutch size, i.e., as egg-clutch size increased, adult weight\ndecreased. All these results show that mass rearing of the gregarious\nectoparasitoid M.dorsiplana was possible under laboratory conditions on an\nalternative bruchid host C.maculatus. As M.dorsiplana is a natural enemy of\nlarval and pupal stages of bruchidae, the next step was to investigate whether\nthe biological control of bruchid C.maculatus was possible in an experimental\nstructure of stored beans.\n",

This is done by reducing the set of differential\nequations to a map that is investigated in the limit of large network size. We\nshow that the stability of the splay state depends crucially on the ratio\nbetween the pulse--width and the inter-spike interval. More precisely, the\nspectrum of Floquet exponents turns out to consist of three components: (i) one\nthat coincides with the predictions of the mean-field analysis [Abbott-van\nVreesvijk, 1993]; (ii) a component measuring the instability of\n\"finite-frequency\" modes; (iii) a number of \"isolated\" eigenvalues that are\nconnected to the characteristics of the single pulse and may give rise to\nstrong instabilities (the Floquet exponent being proportional to the network\nsize). Finally, as a side result, we find that the splay state can be stable\neven for inhibitory coupling.\n",

The exception is white matter, the metabolism of which\nseems to scale with a standard specific exponent -1/4. The scaling exponents\nfor the total oxygen and glucose consumptions in the brain in relation to its\nvolume are identical and equal to $0.86\\pm 0.03$, which is significantly larger\nthan the exponents 3/4 and 2/3 suggested for whole body basal metabolism on\nbody mass.\n  Conclusions: These findings show explicitly that in mammals (i)\nvolume-specific scaling exponents of the cerebral energy expenditure in\ndifferent brain parts are approximately constant (except brain stem\nstructures), and (ii) the total cerebral metabolic exponent against brain\nvolume is greater than the much-cited Kleiber's 3/4 exponent. The\nneurophysiological factors that might account for the regional uniformity of\nthe exponents and for the excessive scaling of the total brain metabolism are\ndiscussed, along with the relationship between brain metabolic scaling and\ncomputation.\n",

One of the main results\ndetermines global asymptotic stability of the network from the diagonal\nstability of a \"dissipativity matrix\" which incorporates information about the\npassivity properties of the subsystems, the interconnection structure of the\nnetwork, and the signs of the interconnection terms. This stability test\nencompasses the \"secant criterion\" for cyclic networks presented in our\nprevious paper, and extends it to a general interconnection structure\nrepresented by a graph. A second main result allows one to accommodate state\nproducts. This extension makes the new stability criterion applicable to a\nbroader class of models, even in the case of cyclic systems. The new stability\ntest is illustrated on a mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade model,\nand on a branched interconnection structure motivated by metabolic networks.\nFinally, another result addresses the robustness of stability in the presence\nof diffusion terms in a compartmental system made out of identical systems.\n",

        "abstract": "  The equilibrium free energy landscape of an off-lattice model protein as a\nfunction of an internal (reaction) coordinate is reconstructed from\nout-of-equilibrium mechanical unfolding manipulations. This task is\naccomplished via two independent methods: by employing an extended version of\nthe Jarzynski equality (EJE) and the protein inherent structures (ISs). In a\nrange of temperatures around the ``folding transition'' we find a good\nquantitative agreement between the free energies obtained via EJE and IS\napproaches. This indicates that the two methodologies are consistent and able\nto reproduce equilibrium properties of the examined system. Moreover, for the\nstudied model the structural transitions induced by pulling can be related to\nthermodynamical aspects of folding.\n",

We introduce a class of stochastic models\nfor animal movement in a habitat of varying preference. Such models interpolate\nbetween spatially-implicit resource selection analysis (RSA) and\nadvection-diffusion models, possessing these two models as limiting cases. We\nfind a closed-form solution for the steady-state (equilibrium) probability\ndistribution u* using a factorization of the redistribution operator into\nsymmetric and diagonal parts. How space use is controlled by the preference\nfunction w then depends on the characteristic width of the redistribution\nkernel: when w changes rapidly compared to this width, u* ~ w, whereas on\nglobal scales large compared to this width, u* ~ w^2. We analyse the behavior\nat discontinuities in w which occur at habitat type boundaries. We simulate the\ndynamics of space use given two-dimensional prey-availability data and explore\nthe effect of the redistribution kernel width. Our factorization allows such\nnumerical simulations to be done extremely fast; we expect this to aid the\ncomputationally-intensive task of model parameter fitting and inverse modeling.\n",

By considering simple model swimmers, and combining\nanalytic and numerical approaches, we investigate the time-averaged flow field\naround a swimmer. At short distances the swimmer behaves like a pump. At large\ndistances the velocity field depends on whether the swimming stroke is\ninvariant under a combined time-reversal and parity transformation. We then\nconsider two swimmers and find that the interaction between them consists of\ntwo parts; a dead term, independent of the motion of the second swimmer, which\ntakes the expected dipolar form and a live term resulting from the simultaneous\nswimming action of both swimmers which does not. We argue that, in general, the\nlatter dominates. The swimmer--swimmer interaction is a complicated function of\ntheir relative displacement, orientation and phase, leading to motion that can\nbe attractive, repulsive or oscillatory.\n",

Previous numerical works have reported that Hebbian\nlearning drives the system from chaos to a steady state through a sequence of\nbifurcations. Here, we interpret these results mathematically and show that\nthese effects, involving a complex coupling between neuronal dynamics and\nsynaptic graph structure, can be analyzed using Jacobian matrices, which\nintroduce both a structural and a dynamical point of view on the neural network\nevolution. Furthermore, we show that the sensitivity to a learned pattern is\nmaximal when the largest Lyapunov exponent is close to 0. We discuss how neural\nnetworks may take advantage of this regime of high functional interest.\n",

        "abstract": "  A spontaneously active neural system that is capable of continual learning\nshould also be capable of homeostasis of both firing rate and connectivity.\nExperimental evidence suggests that both types of homeostasis exist, and that\nconnectivity is maintained at a state that is optimal for information\ntransmission and storage. This state is referred to as the critical state. We\npresent a simple stochastic computational Hebbian learning model that\nincorporates both firing rate and critical homeostasis, and we explore its\nstability and connectivity properties. We also examine the behavior of our\nmodel with a simulated seizure and with simulated acute deafferentation. We\nargue that a neural system that is more highly connected than the critical\nstate (i.e., one that is \"supercritical\") is epileptogenic. Based on our\nsimulations, we predict that the post-seizural and post-deafferentation states\nshould be supercritical and epileptogenic. Furthermore, interventions that\nboost spontaneous activity should be protective against epileptogenesis.\n",

The power spectral density (PSD)\nof the Vm displays a power-law structure at high frequencies (>50 Hz) with a\nslope of about -2.5. This type of frequency scaling cannot be accounted for by\ntraditional models, as either single-compartment models or models based on\nreconstructed cell morphologies display a frequency scaling with a slope close\nto -4. This slope is due to the fact that the membrane resistance is\n\"short-circuited\" by the capacitance for high frequencies, a situation which\nmay not be realistic. Here, we integrate non-ideal capacitors in cable\nequations to reflect the fact that the capacitance cannot be charged\ninstantaneously. We show that the resulting \"non-ideal\" cable model can be\nsolved analytically using Fourier transforms. Numerical simulations using a\nball-and-stick model yield membrane potential activity with similar frequency\nscaling as in the experiments. We also discuss the consequences of using\nnon-ideal capacitors on other cellular properties such as the transmission of\nhigh frequencies, which is boosted in non-ideal cables, or voltage attenuation\nin dendrites. These results suggest that cable equations based on non-ideal\ncapacitors should be used to capture the behavior of neuronal membranes at high\nfrequencies.\n",

        "abstract": "  This paper develops a mathematical model describing the influence that\nconjugation-mediated Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) has on the\nmutation-selection balance in an asexually reproducing population of\nunicellular, prokaryotic organisms. It is assumed that mutation-selection\nbalance is reached in the presence of a fixed background concentration of\nantibiotic, to which the population must become resistant in order to survive.\nWe analyze the behavior of the model in the limit of low and high\nantibiotic-induced first-order death rate constants, and find that the highest\nmean fitness is obtained at low rates of bacterial conjugation. As the rate of\nconjugation crosses a threshold, the mean fitness decreases to a minimum, and\nthen rises asymptotically to a limiting value as the rate of conjugation\nbecomes infinitely large. However, this limiting value is smaller than the mean\nfitness obtained in the limit of low conjugation rate. This dependence of the\nmean fitness on the conjugation rate is fairly small for the parameter ranges\nwe have considered, and disappears as the first-order death rate constant due\nto the presence of antibiotic approaches zero. For large values of the\nantibiotic death rate constant, we have obtained an analytical solution for the\nbehavior of the mean fitness that agrees well with the results of simulations.\nThe results of this paper suggest that conjugation-mediated HGT has a slightly\ndeleterious effect on the mean fitness of a population at mutation-selection\nbalance. Therefore, we argue that HGT confers a selective advantage by allowing\nfor faster adaptation to a new or changing environment. The results of this\npaper are consistent with the observation that HGT can be promoted by\nenvironmental stresses on a population.\n",

        "abstract": "  The problem of reconstructing and identifying intracellular protein signaling\nand biochemical networks is of critical importance in biology today. We sought\nto develop a mathematical approach to this problem using, as a test case, one\nof the most well-studied and clinically important signaling networks in biology\ntoday, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) driven signaling cascade.\nMore specifically, we suggest a method, augmented sparse reconstruction, for\nthe identification of links among nodes of ordinary differential equation (ODE)\nnetworks from a small set of trajectories with different initial conditions.\nOur method builds a system of representation by using a collection of integrals\nof all given trajectories and by attenuating block of terms in the\nrepresentation itself. The system of representation is then augmented with\nrandom vectors, and minimization of the 1-norm is used to find sparse\nrepresentations for the dynamical interactions of each node. Augmentation by\nrandom vectors is crucial, since sparsity alone is not able to handle the large\nerror-in-variables in the representation. Augmented sparse reconstruction\nallows to consider potentially very large spaces of models and it is able to\ndetect with high accuracy the few relevant links among nodes, even when\nmoderate noise is added to the measured trajectories. After showing the\nperformance of our method on a model of the EGFR protein network, we sketch\nbriefly the potential future therapeutic applications of this approach.\n",

        "abstract": "  Recently Supernova 2006gy was noted as the most luminous ever recorded, with\na total radiated energy of ~10^44 Joules. It was proposed that the progenitor\nmay have been a massive evolved star similar to eta Carinae, which resides in\nour own galaxy at a distance of about 2.3 kpc. eta Carinae appears ready to\ndetonate. Although it is too distant to pose a serious threat as a normal\nsupernova, and given its rotation axis is unlikely to produce a Gamma-Ray Burst\noriented toward the Earth, eta Carinae is about 30,000 times nearer than\n2006gy, and we re-evaluate it as a potential superluminous supernova. We find\nthat given the large ratio of emission in the optical to the X-ray, atmospheric\neffects are negligible. Ionization of the atmosphere and concomitant ozone\ndepletion are unlikely to be important. Any cosmic ray effects should be spread\nout over ~10^4 y, and similarly unlikely to produce any serious perturbation to\nthe biosphere. We also discuss a new possible effect of supernovae, endocrine\ndisruption induced by blue light near the peak of the optical spectrum. This is\na possibility for nearby supernovae at distances too large to be considered\n\"dangerous\" for other reasons. However, due to reddening and extinction by the\ninterstellar medium, eta Carinae is unlikely to trigger such effects to any\nsignificant degree.\n",

        "abstract": "  In this paper we apply new geometric and combinatorial methods to the study\nof phylogenetic mixtures. The focus of the geometric approach is to describe\nthe geometry of phylogenetic mixture distributions for the two state random\ncluster model, which is a generalization of the two state symmetric (CFN)\nmodel. In particular, we show that the set of mixture distributions forms a\nconvex polytope and we calculate its dimension; corollaries include a simple\ncriterion for when a mixture of branch lengths on the star tree can mimic the\nsite pattern frequency vector of a resolved quartet tree. Furthermore, by\ncomputing volumes of polytopes we can clarify how ``common'' non-identifiable\nmixtures are under the CFN model. We also present a new combinatorial result\nwhich extends any identifiability result for a specific pair of trees of size\nsix to arbitrary pairs of trees. Next we present a positive result showing\nidentifiability of rates-across-sites models. Finally, we answer a question\nraised in a previous paper concerning ``mixed branch repulsion'' on trees\nlarger than quartet trees under the CFN model.\n",

In most cases, mortality rates decreased in the past century without\nnoticeable decrease in fertility rates, this leads to a significant increase in\npopulation growth. In many poor countries like Palestinian territories the\nnumber of births has fallen and the life expectancy increased.\n  In this article we concentrate on measuring, analyzing and extrapolating the\nage structure in Palestine a few decades ago into future. A Fortran program has\nbeen designed and used for the simulation and analysis of our statistical data.\nThis study of demographic change in Palestine has shown that Palestinians will\nhave in future problems as the strongest age cohorts are the above-60-year\nolds. We therefore recommend the increase of both the retirement age and women\nemployment.\n",

        "abstract": "  Ni\\'eb\\'e is a food leguminous plant cultivated in tropical Africa for its\nseeds rich in proteins. The main problem setted by its production is the\nconservation of harvests. In the fields as in the stocks, the seeds are\ndestroyed by pests (bruchids). These bruchids are always associated with\nseveral entomophagous species of hymenoptera. Four entomophagous species were\nlisted : an egg parasitoid (U lariophaga Stephan), and three solitary larval\nand pupal ectoparasitoids (D. Basalis Rondoni, Pteromalidae; E. vuilleti\nCrawford and E. orientalis Crawford, Eupelmidae). The survey of the populations\nshows that at the beginning of storage, E orientalis is the most abundant\nspecie (72 %) whereas E. vuilleti and D. Basalis respectively represent 12 %\nand 16 % of the hymenoptera. During storage, the E orientalis population\ndecreases gradually and it disappears completely in less than two months after\nthe beginning of storage. E. Vuilleti population becomes gradually more\nimportant than D. basalis population which regress until less than 10 % of the\nemerging parasitoids. E vuilleti adopts ovicide and larvicide behaviour against\nD. Basalis. This behaviour explains its population regression inside granaries.\nIf the aggressive behaviour of this Eupelmidae is a constant, that could also\nexplain the disappearance of E orientalis. However if this species is\nmaintained in stocks, it would be an effective control agent of bruchids\naccording to their parasitic capacities. This study shows that ovicide and\nlarvicide behaviour of E vuilleti is not expressed against E orientalis. When\nthe females have exclusively the hosts already parasitized by E orientalis,\nthey do not lay eggs. The disappearance of E orientalis could not thus be\nexplained by the presence of E. vuilleti.\n",

        "abstract": "  Selective control in a population is the ability to control a member of the\npopulation while leaving the other members relatively unaffected. The concept\nof selective control is developed using cell death or apoptosis in\nheterogeneous cell populations as an example. Apoptosis signaling in\nheterogeneous cells is described by an ensemble of gene networks with identical\ntopology but different link strengths. Selective control depends on the\nstatistics of signaling in the ensemble of networks and we analyse the effects\nof superposition, non-linearity and feedback on these statistics. Parallel\npathways promote normal statistics while series pathways promote skew\ndistributions which in the most extreme cases become log-normal. We also show\nthat feedback and non-linearity can produce bimodal signaling statistics, as\ncan discreteness and non-linearity. Two methods for optimizing selective\ncontrol are presented. The first is an exhaustive search method and the second\nis a linear programming based approach. Though control of a single gene in the\nsignaling network yields little selectivity, control of a few genes typically\nyields higher levels of selectivity. The statistics of gene combinations\nsusceptible to selective control is studied and is used to identify general\ncontrol strategies. We found that selectivity is promoted by acting on the\nleast sensitive nodes in the case of weak populations, while selective control\nof robust populations is optimized through perturbations of more sensitive\nnodes. High throughput experiments with heterogeneous cell lines could be\ndesigned in an analogous manner, with the further possibility of incorporating\nthe selectivity optimization process into a closed-loop control system.\n",

        "abstract": "  Bacterial chemotaxis in Escherichia coli is a canonical system for the study\nof signal transduction. A remarkable feature of this system is the coexistence\nof precise adaptation in population with large fluctuating cellular behavior in\nsingle cells (Korobkova et al. 2004, Nature, 428, 574). Using a stochastic\nmodel, we found that the large behavioral variability experimentally observed\nin non-stimulated cells is a direct consequence of the architecture of this\nadaptive system. Reversible covalent modification cycles, in which methylation\nand demethylation reactions antagonistically regulate the activity of\nreceptor-kinase complexes, operate outside the region of first-order kinetics.\nAs a result, the receptor-kinase that governs cellular behavior exhibits a\nsigmoidal activation curve. This curve simultaneously amplifies the inherent\nstochastic fluctuations in the system and lengthens the relaxation time in\nresponse to stimulus. Because stochastic fluctuations cause large behavioral\nvariability and the relaxation time governs the average duration of runs in\nresponse to small stimuli, cells with the greatest fluctuating behavior also\ndisplay the largest chemotactic response. Finally, Large-scale simulations of\ndigital bacteria suggest that the chemotaxis network is tuned to simultaneously\noptimize the random spread of cells in absence of nutrients and the cellular\nresponse to gradients of attractant.\n",

        "abstract": "  This review presents the elastic theory of low-dimensional (one- and\ntwo-dimensional) continua and its applications in bio- and nano-structures.\nFirst, the curve and surface theory, as the geometric representation of the\nlow-dimensional continua, is briefly described through Cartan moving frame\nmethod. The elastic theory of Kirchhoff rod, Helfrich rod, bending-soften rod,\nfluid membrane, and solid shell is revisited. Secondly, the application and\navailability of the elastic theory of low-dimensional continua in\nbio-structures, including short DNA rings, lipid membranes, and cell membranes,\nare discussed. The kink stability of short DNA rings is addressed by using the\ntheory of Kirchhoff rod, Helfrich rod, and bending-soften rod. The lipid\nmembranes obey the theory of fluid membrane. A cell membrane is simplified as a\ncomposite shell of lipid bilayer and membrane skeleton, which is a little\nsimilar to the solid shell. It is found that the membrane skeleton enhances\nhighly the mechanical stability of cell membranes. Thirdly, the application and\navailability of the elastic theory of low-dimensional continua in\nnano-structures, including graphene and carbon nanotubes, are discussed. A\nrevised Lenosky lattice model is proposed based on the local density\napproximation. Its continuum form up to the second order terms of curvatures\nand strains is the same as the free energy of 2D solid shells. Several typical\nmechanical properties of carbon nanotubes are revisited and investigated based\non this continuum form. It is possible to avoid introducing the controversial\nconcepts, the Young's modulus and thickness of graphene and single-walled\ncarbon nanotubes, with this continuum form.\n",

By means\nof the multi-self-overlap ensemble (MSOE) Monte Carlo method and the principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA), the free-energy landscape is obtained. It is shown\nthat kinesins have two subdomains that exhibit partial folding/unfolding at\nfunctionally important regions: one is located around the nucleotide binding\nsite and the other includes the main microtubule binding site. These subdomains\nare consistent with structural variability that was reported recently based on\nexperimentally-obtained structures. On the other hand, such large structural\nfluctuations have not been captured by B-factor or normal mode analyses. Thus,\nthey are beyond the elastic regime, and it is essential to take into account\nchain connectivity for studying the function of kinesins.\n",

        "abstract": "  The binding neuron model is inspired by numerical simulation of\nHodgkin-Huxley-type point neuron, as well as by the leaky integrate-and-fire\nmodel. In the binding neuron, the trace of an input is remembered for a fixed\nperiod of time after which it disappears completely. This is in the contrast\nwith the above two models, where the postsynaptic potentials decay\nexponentially and can be forgotten only after triggering. The finiteness of\nmemory in the binding neuron allows one to construct fast recurrent networks\nfor computer modeling. Recently, the finiteness is utilized for exact\nmathematical description of the output stochastic process if the binding neuron\nis driven with the Poissonian input stream. In this paper, the simplest\nnetworking is considered for binding neuron. Namely, it is expected that every\noutput spike of single neuron is immediately fed into its input. For this\nconstruction, externally fed with Poissonian stream, the output stream is\ncharacterized in terms of interspike interval probability density distribution\nif the binding neuron has threshold 2. For higher thresholds, the distribution\nis calculated numerically. The distributions are compared with those found for\nbinding neuron without feedback, and for leaky integrator. Sample distributions\nfor leaky integrator with feedback are calculated numerically as well. It is\noncluded that even the simplest networking can radically alter spikng\nstatistics. Information condensation at the level of single neuron is\ndiscussed.\n",

        "abstract": "  The binding neuron model is inspired by numerical simulation of\nHodgkin-Huxley-type point neuron, as well as by the leaky integrate-and-fire\nmodel. In the binding neuron, the trace of an input is remembered for a fixed\nperiod of time after which it disappears completely. This is in the contrast\nwith the above two models, where the postsynaptic potentials decay\nexponentially and can be forgotten only after triggering. The finiteness of\nmemory in the binding neuron allows one to construct fast recurrent networks\nfor computer modeling. Recently, the finiteness is utilized for exact\nmathematical description of the output stochastic process if the binding neuron\nis driven with the Poissonian input stream. In this paper, the simplest\nnetworking is considered for binding neuron. Namely, it is expected that every\noutput spike of single neuron is immediately fed into its input. For this\nconstruction, externally fed with Poissonian stream, the output stream is\ncharacterized in terms of interspike interval probability density distribution\nif the binding neuron has threshold 2. For higher thresholds, the distribution\nis calculated numerically. The distributions are compared with those found for\nbinding neuron without feedback, and for leaky integrator. Sample distributions\nfor leaky integrator with feedback are calculated numerically as well. It is\noncluded that even the simplest networking can radically alter spikng\nstatistics. Information condensation at the level of single neuron is\ndiscussed.\n",

In general, the cooperative folding routes have sharper\ninterfaces between folded and unfolded regions of the folding nucleus and\nhigher free energy barriers. The calculated free energy barriers are strongly\ncorrelated with native topology as characterized by contact order. Increasing\nthe rigidity of the folding nucleus changes the local structure of the\ntransition state ensemble non-uniformly across the set of protein studied.\nNeverthless, the calculated prefactors k0 are found to be relatively uniform\nacross the protein set, with variation in 1/k0 less than a factor of five. This\ndirect calculation justifies the common assumption that the prefactor is\nroughly the same for all small two-state folding proteins. Using the barrier\nheights obtained from the model and the best fit monomer relaxation time 30ns,\nwe find that 1/k0 (1-5)us (with average 1/k0 4us). This model can be extended\nto study subtle aspects of folding such as the variation of the folding rate\nwith stability or solvent viscosity, and the onset of downhill folding.\n",

Their classical representation has\nproven useful but is inconsistent in the meaning assigned to each arrow (or\nedge) and inadvertently implies the isolation of one pathway from another.\nConversely, modern high-throughput experiments give rise to standardized\nnetworks facilitating topological calculations. Combining these perspectives,\nwe can embed classical pathways within large-scale networks and thus\ndemonstrate the crosstalk between them. As more diverse types of\nhigh-throughput data become available, we can effectively merge both\nperspectives, embedding pathways simultaneously in multiple networks. However,\nthe original problem still remains - the current edge representation is\ninadequate to accurately convey all the information in pathways. Therefore, we\nsuggest that a standardized, well-defined, edge ontology is necessary and\npropose a prototype here, as a starting point for reaching this goal.\n",

The relationships between the\nconcentration of metal in the growth medium, Cs, the concentration of metal\nabsorbed by the plant, Cp, and the total biomass achieved, M, all of which are\nfactors relevant to the efficiency of phytoremediation of the plant, have been\ninvestigated via the macro-physiological response of Brassica juncea seedlings\nto Ni(II) stress. The factorial growth experiments treated the Ni(II)\nconcentration in the agar gel and the diurnal light quanta (DLQ) as\nindependently variable parameters. Observations included the evidence of light\nenhancement of Ni toxicity at the root as well as at the whole plant level, the\nshoot mass index as a possible indicator of shoot metal sequestration in B.\njuncea, the logarithmic variation of Cp with Cs and the power-law dependence of\nM on Cp. The sum total of these observations indicate that for the metal\naccumulator B. juncea with regard to its capacity to accumulate Ni, the overall\nmetabolic nature of the plant is important; neither rapid biomass increase nor\na high metal concentration capability favor the removal of high metal mass from\nthe medium, but rather the plant with the moderate photosynthetically driven\nbiomass growth and moderate metal concentrations demonstrated the ability to\nremove the maximum mass of metal from the medium. The implications of these\nobservations in the context of the perceived need in phytoremediation\nengineering to maximize Cp and M simultaneously in the same plant, are\ndiscussed.\n",

        "abstract": "  We consider an asexual population evolving on rugged fitness landscapes which\nare defined on the multi-dimensional genotypic space and have many local\noptima. We track the most populated genotype as it changes when the population\njumps from a fitness peak to a better one during the process of adaptation.\nThis is done using the dynamics of the shell model which is a simplified\nversion of the quasispecies model for infinite populations and standard\nWright-Fisher dynamics for large finite populations. We show that the\npopulation fraction of a genotype obtained within the quasispecies model and\nthe shell model match for fit genotypes and at short times, but the dynamics of\nthe two models are identical for questions related to the most populated\ngenotype. We calculate exactly several properties of the jumps in infinite\npopulations some of which were obtained numerically in previous works. We also\npresent our preliminary simulation results for finite populations. In\nparticular, we measure the jump distribution in time and find that it decays as\n$t^{-2}$ as in the quasispecies problem.\n",

The pioneering work by Nowak and May showed that large\ninitial populations of cooperators can survive and sustain cooperation in a\nsquare lattice with imitate-the-best evolutionary dynamics. We revisit this\nproblem in a cost-benefit formulation suitable for a number of biological\napplications. We show that if a fixed-amount reward is established for\ncooperators to share, a single cooperator can invade a population of defectors\nand form structures that are resilient to re-invasion even if the reward\nmechanism is turned off. We discuss analytically the case of the invasion by a\nsingle cooperator and present agent-based simulations for small initial\nfractions of cooperators. Large cooperation levels, in the sustainability\nrange, are found. In the conclusions we discuss possible applications of this\nmodel as well as its connections with other mechanisms proposed to promote the\nemergence of cooperation.\n",

In the Earth, U and Th can combine with oxidative\nvolatile components and water, migrate up to the asthenosphere position to form\nan enrichment zone (EZ) of U and Th first, and then migrate up further to the\ncrusts through magmatism and metamorphism. We emphasize that the formation of\nan EZ of U, Th and other heat-producing elements is a prerequisite for the\nformation of a plate tectonic system. The heat-producing elements, currently\nmainly U and Th, in the EZ are also the energy sources that drive the formation\nand evolution of the crust of Earth and create special granitic continental\ncrusts. In other terrestrial planets, including Mercury, Venus, and Mars, an EZ\ncan not be formed because of a lack of oxidative volatile components and water.\nFor this reason, a plate tectonic system can not been developed in these\nplanets. We also emphasize the influence of U and Th in EZ on the development\nand evolution of life on Earth. We propose that since the Earth and planets\nwere born in a united solar system, there should be some common mechanisms to\ncreate the similarities and differences between them. We have tried to develop\nan integrated view to explain some problems in the tectonics of Earth and\nevolution, bio-evolution, and planetary dynamics through U and Th geochemistry.\nWe believe that a comprehensive exploration on energy sources and their\nevolution is a good way to build bridges between different disciplines of\nscience in order to better understand the Earth and planets.\n",

We introduce and apply a general method, based on the spectrum of\nthe normalized graph Laplacian, that yields repre- sentations, the spectral\nplots, that allow us to find and visualize such properties systematically. We\npresent such visualizations for a wide range of biological networks and compare\nthem with those for networks derived from theoretical schemes. The differences\nthat we find are quite striking and suggest that the search for universal\nproperties of biological networks should be complemented by an understanding of\nmore specific features of biological organization principles at different\nscales.\n",

        "abstract": "  Cortical neurons are subject to sustained and irregular synaptic activity\nwhich causes important fluctuations of the membrane potential (Vm). We review\nhere different methods to characterize this activity and its impact on spike\ngeneration. The simplified, fluctuating point-conductance model of synaptic\nactivity provides the starting point of a variety of methods for the analysis\nof intracellular Vm recordings. In this model, the synaptic excitatory and\ninhibitory conductances are described by Gaussian-distributed stochastic\nvariables, or colored conductance noise. The matching of experimentally\nrecorded Vm distributions to an invertible theoretical expression derived from\nthe model allows the extraction of parameters characterizing the synaptic\nconductance distributions. This analysis can be complemented by the matching of\nexperimental Vm power spectral densities (PSDs) to a theoretical template, even\nthough the unexpected scaling properties of experimental PSDs limit the\nprecision of this latter approach. Building on this stochastic characterization\nof synaptic activity, we also propose methods to qualitatively and\nquantitatively evaluate spike-triggered averages of synaptic time-courses\npreceding spikes. This analysis points to an essential role for synaptic\nconductance variance in determining spike times. The presented methods are\nevaluated using controlled conductance injection in cortical neurons in vitro\nwith the dynamic-clamp technique. We review their applications to the analysis\nof in vivo intracellular recordings in cat association cortex, which suggest a\npredominant role for inhibition in determining both sub- and supra-threshold\ndynamics of cortical neurons embedded in active networks.\n",

        "abstract": "  The influence of three well-known disaccharides, namely trehalose, maltose\nand sucrose, on some structural and dynamical properties of lysozyme has been\ninvestigated by means of molecular dynamics computer simulations in the 37-60\nwt % concentration range. The effects of sugars on the protein conformation are\nfound relatively weak, in agreement with the preferential hydration of\nlysozyme. Conversely, sugars seem to increase significantly the relaxation\ntimes of the protein. These effects are shown to be correlated to the\nfractional solvent accessibilities of lysozyme residues and further support the\nslaving of protein dynamics. Moreover, a significant increase in the relaxation\ntimes of lysozyme, sugars and water molecules is observed within the studied\nconcentration range and may result from the percolation of the hydrogen-bond\nnetwork of sugar molecules. This percolation appears to be of primary\nimportance to explain the influence of sugars on the dynamical properties of\nlysozyme and water.\n",

        "abstract": "  Background The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently\noverexpressed in many cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In\nsilcio modeling is considered to be an increasingly promising tool to add\nuseful insights into the dynamics of the EGFR signal transduction pathway.\nHowever, most of the previous modeling work focused on the molecular or the\ncellular level only, neglecting the crucial feedback between these scales as\nwell as the interaction with the heterogeneous biochemical microenvironment.\n  Results We developed a multiscale model for investigating expansion dynamics\nof NSCLC within a two-dimensional in silico microenvironment. At the molecular\nlevel, a specific EGFR-ERK intracellular signal transduction pathway was\nimplemented. Dynamical alterations of these molecules were used to trigger\nphenotypic changes at the cellular level. Examining the relationship between\nextrinsic ligand concentrations, intrinsic molecular profiles and microscopic\npatterns, the results confirmed that increasing the amount of available growth\nfactor leads to a spatially more aggressive cancer system. Moreover, for the\ncell closest to nutrient abundance, a phase-transition emerges where a minimal\nincrease in extrinsic ligand abolishes the proliferative phenotype altogether.\n  Conclusions Our in silico results indicate that, in NSCLC, in the presence of\na strong extrinsic chemotactic stimulus, and depending on the cell's location,\ndownstream EGFR-ERK signaling may be processed more efficiently, thereby\nyielding a migration-dominant cell phenotype and overall, an accelerated\nspatio-temporal expansion rate.\n",

The rate at which the difference map produces low\nenergy protein conformations is compared with that of a contemporary search\nalgorithm, parallel tempering. The results indicate the difference map finds\nlow energy protein conformations at a significantly higher rate then parallel\ntempering.\n",

        "abstract": "  The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects more than 90% of the human population,\nand is the cause of several both serious and mild diseases. It is a\ntumorivirus, and has been widely studied as a model system for gene\n(de)regulation in human. A central feature of the EBV life cycle is its ability\nto persist in human B cells in states denoted latency I, II and III. In latency\nIII the host cell is driven to cell proliferation and hence expansion of the\nviral population, but does not enter the lytic pathway, and no new virions are\nproduced, while the latency I state is almost completely dormant. In this paper\nwe study a physico-chemical model of the switch between latency I and latency\nIII in EBV. We show that the unusually large number of binding sites of two\ncompeting transcription factors, one viral and one from the host, serves to\nmake the switch sharper (higher Hill coefficient), either by cooperative\nbinding between molecules of the same species when they bind, or by competition\nbetween the two species if there is sufficient steric hindrance.\n",

Probability density\nfunctions for generation intervals have been an important input for epidemic\nmodels and epidemic data analysis. In this paper, we specify a general\nstochastic SIR epidemic model and prove that the mean generation interval\ndecreases when susceptible persons are at risk of infectious contact from\nmultiple sources. The intuition behind this is that when a susceptible person\nhas multiple potential infectors, there is a ``race'' to infect him or her in\nwhich only the first infectious contact leads to infection. In an epidemic, the\nmean generation interval contracts as the prevalence of infection increases. We\ncall this global competition among potential infectors. When there is rapid\ntransmission within clusters of contacts, generation interval contraction can\nbe caused by a high local prevalence of infection even when the global\nprevalence is low. We call this local competition among potential infectors.\nUsing simulations, we illustrate both types of competition.\n  Finally, we show that hazards of infectious contact can be used instead of\ngeneration intervals to estimate the time course of the effective reproductive\nnumber in an epidemic. This approach leads naturally to partial likelihoods for\nepidemic data that are very similar to those that arise in survival analysis,\nopening a promising avenue of methodological research in infectious disease\nepidemiology.\n",

Experimentally, Min oscillations are seen in newly\ndivided cells and no minicells are produced. In model Min systems many daughter\ncells do not oscillate following septation because of unequal partitioning of\nMin proteins between the daughter cells. Using the 3D model of Huang et al., we\ninvestigate the septation process in detail to determine the cause of the\nasymmetric partitioning of Min proteins between daughter cells. We find that\nthis partitioning problem arises at certain phases of the MinD and MinE\noscillations with respect to septal closure and it persists independently of\nparameter variation. At most 85% of the daughter cells exhibit Min oscillation\nfollowing septation. Enhanced MinD binding at the static polar and dynamic\nseptal regions, consistent with cardiolipin domains, does not substantially\nincrease this fraction of oscillating daughters. We believe that this problem\nwill be shared among all existing Min models and discuss possible biological\nmechanisms that may minimize partitioning errors of Min proteins following\nseptation.\n",

In this paper we explore\nthe question of whether one can reconstruct a pedigree by just observing\nsequence data for present day individuals. This is motivated by the increasing\navailability of genomic sequences, but in this paper we take a more theoretical\napproach and consider what models of sequence evolution might allow pedigree\nreconstruction (given sufficiently long sequences). Our results complement\nrecent work that showed that pedigree reconstruction may be fundamentally\nimpossible if one uses just the degrees of relatedness between different extant\nindividuals. We find that for certain stochastic processes, pedigrees can be\nrecovered up to isomorphism from sufficiently long sequences.\n",

        "abstract": "  The aim of the present paper is to study the effects of Hebbian learning in\nrandom recurrent neural networks with biological connectivity, i.e. sparse\nconnections and separate populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We\nfurthermore consider that the neuron dynamics may occur at a (shorter) time\nscale than synaptic plasticity and consider the possibility of learning rules\nwith passive forgetting. We show that the application of such Hebbian learning\nleads to drastic changes in the network dynamics and structure. In particular,\nthe learning rule contracts the norm of the weight matrix and yields a rapid\ndecay of the dynamics complexity and entropy. In other words, the network is\nrewired by Hebbian learning into a new synaptic structure that emerges with\nlearning on the basis of the correlations that progressively build up between\nneurons. We also observe that, within this emerging structure, the strongest\nsynapses organize as a small-world network. The second effect of the decay of\nthe weight matrix spectral radius consists in a rapid contraction of the\nspectral radius of the Jacobian matrix. This drives the system through the\n``edge of chaos'' where sensitivity to the input pattern is maximal. Taken\ntogether, this scenario is remarkably predicted by theoretical arguments\nderived from dynamical systems and graph theory.\n",

        "abstract": "  The purpose of the present experiment was to investigate whether the sensory\nweighting of a plantar pressure-based, tongue-placed tactile biofeedback for\ncontrolling posture could be subject to inter-individual variability. To\nachieve this goal, 60 young healthy adults were asked to stand as immobile as\npossible with their eyes closed in two conditions of No-biofeedback and\nBiofeedback. Centre of foot pressure (CoP) displacements were recorded using a\nforce platform. Overall, results showed reduced CoP displacements in the\nBiofeedback relative to the No-biofeedback condition, evidencing the ability of\nthe central nervous system to efficiently integrate an artificial\nplantar-based, tongue-placed tactile biofeedback for controlling posture during\nquiet standing. Results further showed a significant positive correlation\nbetween the CoP displacements measured in the No-biofeedback condition and the\ndecrease in the CoP displacements induced by the use of the biofeedback. In\nother words, the degree of postural stabilization appeared to depend on each\nsubject's balance control capabilities, the biofeedback yielding a greater\nstabilizing effect in subjects exhibiting the largest CoP displacements when\nstanding in the No-biofeedback condition. On the whole, by evidencing a\nsignificant inter-individual variability in sensory weighting of an additional\ntactile information related to foot sole pressure distribution for controlling\nposture, the present findings underscore the need and the necessity to address\nthe issue of inter-individual variability in the field of neuroscience.\n",

The allelic\npartition associated with a coalescent process started from n individuals is\nobtained by placing mutations along the skeleton of the coalescent tree; for\neach individual, we trace back to the most recent mutation affecting it and\ngroup together individuals whose most recent mutations are the same. The number\nof blocks of each of the different possible sizes in this partition is the\nallele frequency spectrum. The celebrated Ewens sampling formula gives precise\nprobabilities for the allele frequency spectrum associated with Kingman's\ncoalescent. This (and the degenerate star-shaped coalescent) are the only\nLambda coalescents for which explicit probabilities are known, although they\nare known to satisfy a recursion due to Moehle. Recently, Berestycki,\nBerestycki and Schweinsberg have proved asymptotic results for the allele\nfrequency spectra of the Beta(2-alpha,alpha) coalescents with alpha in (1,2).\nIn this paper, we prove full asymptotics for the case of the\nBolthausen-Sznitman coalescent.\n",

Drawing on\nthese results, we explain how clonal fate data may be used to infer the rules\nof cell division and differentiation underlying the maintenance of adult murine\ntail-skin. We show that the rates of cell division and differentiation may be\nevaluated by considering the long-time and short-time clone fate data, and that\nthe data is consistent with cells dividing independently rather than\nsynchronously. Motivated by these findings, we consider a mechanism for cancer\nonset based closely on the model for normal adult skin. By analysing the\nexpected changes to clonal fate in cancer emerging from a simple two-stage\nmutation, we propose that clonal fate data may provide a novel method for\nstudying the earliest stages of the disease.\n",

The crossover manifests itself in the transition from n=5/3\nto n=3. Our microscopic model represents a single lipid molecule as a worm-like\nchain with finite irreducible cross-section area A_0, flexural rigidity K and\nstretching modulus Q in a parabolic potential with self-consistent curvature\nB(A) formed by entropic interactions between hydrocarbon chains in the lipid\nlayer. The crossover area per lipid A* obeys relation Q^2/(KB(A*))~1 . We\npredict a peculiar possibility to deduce effective elastic moduli K and Q of\nthe individual hydrocarbon chain from the analysis of the isotherm possessing\nsuch crossover. Also calculated is crossover-related behavior of the area\ncompressibility modulus K_a, equilibrium area per lipid A_t, and chain order\nparameter S.\n",

The crossover manifests itself in the transition from n=5/3\nto n=3. Our microscopic model represents a single lipid molecule as a worm-like\nchain with finite irreducible cross-section area A_0, flexural rigidity K and\nstretching modulus Q in a parabolic potential with self-consistent curvature\nB(A) formed by entropic interactions between hydrocarbon chains in the lipid\nlayer. The crossover area per lipid A* obeys relation Q^2/(KB(A*))~1 . We\npredict a peculiar possibility to deduce effective elastic moduli K and Q of\nthe individual hydrocarbon chain from the analysis of the isotherm possessing\nsuch crossover. Also calculated is crossover-related behavior of the area\ncompressibility modulus K_a, equilibrium area per lipid A_t, and chain order\nparameter S.\n",

We develop a general framework for the computation of exponential\ngrowth rate and the sub exponential factors for $k$-noncrossing RNA structures.\nOur results are based on the generating function for the number of\n$k$-noncrossing RNA pseudoknot structures, ${\\sf S}_k(n)$, derived in\n\\cite{Reidys:07pseu}, where $k-1$ denotes the maximal size of sets of mutually\nintersecting bonds. We prove a functional equation for the generating function\n$\\sum_{n\\ge 0}{\\sf S}_k(n)z^n$ and obtain for $k=2$ and $k=3$ the analytic\ncontinuation and singular expansions, respectively. It is implicit in our\nresults that for arbitrary $k$ singular expansions exist and via transfer\ntheorems of analytic combinatorics we obtain asymptotic expression for the\ncoefficients. We explicitly derive the asymptotic expressions for 2- and\n3-noncrossing RNA structures. Our main result is the derivation of the formula\n${\\sf S}_3(n) \\sim \\frac{10.4724\\cdot 4!}{n(n-1)...(n-4)}\n(\\frac{5+\\sqrt{21}}{2})^n$.\n",

        "abstract": "  Neurons in the input layer of primary visual cortex in primates develop\nedge-like receptive fields. One approach to understanding the emergence of this\nresponse is to state that neural activity has to efficiently represent sensory\ndata with respect to the statistics of natural scenes. Furthermore, it is\nbelieved that such an efficient coding is achieved using a competition across\nneurons so as to generate a sparse representation, that is, where a relatively\nsmall number of neurons are simultaneously active. Indeed, different models of\nsparse coding, coupled with Hebbian learning and homeostasis, have been\nproposed that successfully match the observed emergent response. However, the\nspecific role of homeostasis in learning such sparse representations is still\nlargely unknown. By quantitatively assessing the efficiency of the neural\nrepresentation during learning, we derive a cooperative homeostasis mechanism\nthat optimally tunes the competition between neurons within the sparse coding\nalgorithm. We apply this homeostasis while learning small patches taken from\nnatural images and compare its efficiency with state-of-the-art algorithms.\nResults show that while different sparse coding algorithms give similar coding\nresults, the homeostasis provides an optimal balance for the representation of\nnatural images within the population of neurons. Competition in sparse coding\nis optimized when it is fair. By contributing to optimizing statistical\ncompetition across neurons, homeostasis is crucial in providing a more\nefficient solution to the emergence of independent components.\n",

The\nparticular activating irradiation times can vary with source of a given enzyme\nand thus, presumably, its molecular structure. The experiments reported here\ndemonstrate that the potential for this anomalous enzyme reaction rate\nenhancement can be transferred from one bacterial species to another coincident\nwith transfer of the genetic determinant for the relevant enzyme. In\nparticular, the effect of crystal-irradiated chloramphenicol on growth of\nbacterial strains in which a transferable R-factor DNA plasmid coding for\nchloramphenicol resistance was or was not present (S. panama R+, E. coli R+,\nand E. coli R-) was determined. Chloramphenicol samples irradiated 10, 35 and\n60 sec produced increased growth rates (diminished inhibition) for the\nresistant S. panama and E. coli strains, while having no such effect on growth\nrate of the sensitive E. coli strain. Consistent with past findings,\nchloramphenicol samples irradiated 5, 30 and 55 sec produced decreased growth\nrates (increased inhibition) for all three strains.\n",

The z transform\nof the recursion relation straightforwardly gives the generating function for\npath PDFs, from which we obtain the Green's function of the random walk, and\nderive an explicit expression for any path PDF of the random walk.

Previous models of run and tumble chemotaxis neglect one or more\nfeatures of the motion, namely (i) a cell cannot directly detect a\nchemoattractant gradient but rather makes temporal comparisons of\nchemoattractant concentration, (ii) rather than being entirely random, tumbles\nexhibit persistence of direction, meaning that the new direction after a tumble\nis more likely to be in the forward hemisphere, and (iii) rotational Brownian\nmotion makes it impossible for an E. coli cell to swim in a straight line\nduring a run. This paper presents an analytic calculation of the chemotactic\ndrift velocity taking account of (i), (ii) and (iii), for weak chemotaxis. The\nanalytic results are verified by Monte Carlo simulation. The results reveal a\nsynergy between temporal comparisons and persistence that enhances the drift\nvelocity, while rotational Brownian motion reduces the drift velocity.\n",

        "abstract": "  We show that the critical mass M_c=8\\pi of bacterial populations in two\ndimensions in the chemotactic problem is the counterpart of the critical\ntemperature T_c=GMm/4k_B of self-gravitating Brownian particles in\ntwo-dimensional gravity. We obtain these critical values by using the Virial\ntheorem or by considering stationary solutions of the Keller-Segel model and\nSmoluchowski-Poisson system. We also consider the case of one dimensional\nsystems and develop the connection with the Burgers equation. Finally, we\ndiscuss the evolution of the system as a function of M or T in bounded and\nunbounded domains in dimensions d=1, 2 and 3 and show the specificities of each\ndimension. This paper aims to point out the numerous analogies between\nbacterial populations, self-gravitating Brownian particles and, occasionally,\ntwo-dimensional vortices.\n",

        "abstract": "  The spatial structure of populations is a key element in the understanding of\nthe large scale spreading of epidemics. Motivated by the recent empirical\nevidence on the heterogeneous properties of transportation and commuting\npatterns among urban areas, we present a thorough analysis of the behavior of\ninfectious diseases in metapopulation models characterized by heterogeneous\nconnectivity and mobility patterns. We derive the basic reaction-diffusion\nequation describing the metapopulation system at the mechanistic level and\nderive an early stage dynamics approximation for the subpopulation invasion\ndynamics. The analytical description uses degree block variables that allows us\nto take into account arbitrary degree distribution of the metapopulation\nnetwork. We show that along with the usual single population epidemic threshold\nthe metapopulation network exhibits a global threshold for the subpopulation\ninvasion. We find an explicit analytic expression for the invasion threshold\nthat determines the minimum number of individuals traveling among\nsubpopulations in order to have the infection of a macroscopic number of\nsubpopulations. The invasion threshold is a function of factors such as the\nbasic reproductive number, the infectious period and the mobility process and\nit is found to decrease for increasing network heterogeneity. We provide\nextensive mechanistic numerical Monte Carlo simulations that recover the\nanalytical finding in a wide range of metapopulation network connectivity\npatterns. The results can be useful in the understanding of recent data driven\ncomputational approaches to disease spreading in large transportation networks\nand the effect of containment measures such as travel restrictions.\n",

Very little is known\nat present on how tissue level properties are related to cell and subcellular\nproperties. Modern measurement techniques provide quantitative results at both\nthe intracellular and tissue level, but not on the connection between these. In\nthe present work we outline a framework to address this connection. We\nspecifically concentrate on the morphogenetic process of tissue fusion, by\nfollowing the coalescence of two contiguous multicellular aggregates. The time\nevolution of this process can accurately be described by the theory of viscous\nliquids. We also study fusion by Monte Carlo simulations and a novel Cellular\nParticle Dynamics (CPD) model, which is similar to the earlier introduced\nSubcellular Element Model (Newman, 2005). Using the combination of experiments,\ntheory and modeling we are able to relate the measured tissue level biophysical\nquantities to subcellular parameters. Our approach has validity beyond the\nparticular morphogenetic process considered here and provides a general way to\nrelate biophysical properties across scales.\n",

        "abstract": "  Cells store information in DNA and in stable programs of gene expression,\nwhich thereby implement forms of long-term cellular memory. Cells must also\npossess short-term forms of information storage, implemented\npost-translationally, to transduce and interpret external signals. CaMKII, for\ninstance, is thought to implement a one-bit (bistable) short-term memory\nrequired for learning at post-synaptic densities. Here we show by mathematical\nanalysis that multisite protein phosphorylation, which is ubiquitous in all\neukaryotic signalling pathways, exhibits multistability for which the maximal\nnumber of steady states increases with the number of sites. If there are n\nsites, the maximal information storage capacity is at least log_2 (n+2)/2 bits\nwhen n is even and log_2 (n+1)/2 bits when n is odd. Furthermore, when\nsubstrate is in excess, enzyme saturation together with an alternating low/high\npattern in the site-specific relative catalytic efficiencies, enriches for\nmultistability. That is, within physiologically plausible ranges for\nparameters, multistability becomes more likely than monostability. We discuss\nthe experimental challenges in pursuing these predictions and in determining\nthe biological role of short-term information storage.\n",

        "abstract": "  We studied the dynamical response of a nanomechanical resonator to\nbiomolecular (e.g. DNA) adsorptions on a resonator's surface by using a\ntheoretical model, which considers the Hamiltonian H such that the potential\nenergy consists of elastic bending energy of a resonator and the potential\nenergy for biomolecular interactions. It was shown that the resonant frequency\nshift of a resonator due to biomolecular adsorption depends on not only the\nmass of adsorbed biomolecules but also the biomolecular interactions.\nSpecifically, for dsDNA adsorption on a resonator's surface, the resonant\nfrequency shift is also dependent on the ionic strength of a solvent, implying\nthe role of molecular interactions on the dynamic behavior of a resonator. This\nindicates that nanomechanical resonators may enable one to quantify the\nbiomolecular mass, implying the enumeration of biomolecules, as well as gain\ninsight into intermolecular interactions between adsorbed biomolecules on the\nsurface.\n",

        "abstract": "  Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are very selective filters that monitor the\ntransport between the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm. Two models have been\nsuggested for the plug of the NPC. They are (i) it is a reversible hydrogel or\n(ii) it is a polymer brush. We propose a mesoscopic model for the transport of\na protein through the plug, that is general enough to cover both. The protein\nstretches the plug and creates a local deformation. The bubble so created\n(prtoein+deformation) executes random walk in the plug. We find that for faster\nrelaxation of the gel, the diffusion of the bubble is greater. Further, on\nusing parameters appropriate for the brush, we find that the diffusion\ncoefficient is much lower. Hence the gel model seems to be more likely\nexplanation for the workings of the plug.\n",

At small to moderate forces, satisfying the\ncondition $FN^{\\nu}/k_BT\\lesssim1$, where $\\nu\\approx0.588$ is the Flory\nexponent for the polymer, we find that $\\tau_N$, the mean time the polymer\ntakes to leave the pore, scales as $N^{2+\\nu}$ independent of $F$, in agreement\nwith our earlier result for F=0. At strong forces, i.e., for\n$FN^{\\nu}/k_BT\\gg1$, the behaviour of the passage time crosses over to\n$\\tau_N\\sim N^2/F$. We show here that these behaviours stem from the polymer\ndynamics at the immediate vicinity of the pore -- in particular, the memory\neffects in the polymer chain tension imbalance across the pore.\n",

        "abstract": "  The diversity of virus populations within single infected hosts presents a\nmajor difficulty for the natural immune response as well as for vaccine design\nand antiviral drug therapy. Recently developed pyrophosphate based sequencing\ntechnologies (pyrosequencing) can be used for quantifying this diversity by\nultra-deep sequencing of virus samples. We present computational methods for\nthe analysis of such sequence data and apply these techniques to pyrosequencing\ndata obtained from HIV populations within patients harboring drug resistant\nvirus strains. Our main result is the estimation of the population structure of\nthe sample from the pyrosequencing reads. This inference is based on a\nstatistical approach to error correction, followed by a combinatorial algorithm\nfor constructing a minimal set of haplotypes that explain the data. Using this\nset of explaining haplotypes, we apply a statistical model to infer the\nfrequencies of the haplotypes in the population via an EM algorithm. We\ndemonstrate that pyrosequencing reads allow for effective population\nreconstruction by extensive simulations and by comparison to 165 sequences\nobtained directly from clonal sequencing of four independent, diverse HIV\npopulations. Thus, pyrosequencing can be used for cost-effective estimation of\nthe structure of virus populations, promising new insights into viral\nevolutionary dynamics and disease control strategies.\n",

We compare these analytic results to numerical\ncalculations for the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron and we apply the method to neurons\nin the olfactory bulb of mice. This observation allows us to relate the\nstimulus-response properties of a neuron to its dynamics, bridging the gap\nbetween dynamical and information theoretic approaches to understanding brain\ncomputations and facilitating the interpretation of changes in channels and\nother cellular properties as influencing the representation of stimuli.\n",

The extent of `gaps' (missing transitional stages)\nhas been used to argue against gradual evolution from a common ancestor.\nTraditionally, gaps have often been explained by the improbability of\nfossilization and the discontinuous selection of found fossils. Here we take an\nanalytical approach and demonstrate why, under certain sampling conditions, we\nmay not expect intermediates to be found. Using a simple null model, we show\nmathematically that the question of whether a taxon sampled from some time in\nthe past is likely to be morphologically intermediate to other samples (dated\nearlier and later) depends on the shape and dimensions of the underlying\nphylogenetic tree that connects the taxa, and the times from which the fossils\nare sampled.\n",

It provides the same advantages as Xenopus laevis but is\ndiploid and has a smaller genome of 1.7 Gbp. Therefore X. tropicalis is more\namenable to systematic transcriptome surveys. We initiated a large-scale\npartial cDNA sequencing project to provide a functional genomics resource on\ngenes expressed in the nervous system during early embryogenesis and\nmetamorphosis in X. tropicalis. A gene index was defined and analysed after the\ncollection of over 48,785 high quality sequences. Partial cDNA sequences were\nobtained from an embryonic head and retina library (30,272 sequences) and from\na metamorphic brain and spinal cord library (27,602 sequences). These ESTs are\nestimated to represent 9,693 transcripts derived from an estimated 6,000 genes.\nAn estimated 46% of these cDNA sequences contain their start codon. Further\nannotation included Gene Ontology functional classification, InterPro domain\nanalysis, alternative splicing and non-coding RNA identification. Gene\nexpression profiles were derived from EST counts and used to define transcripts\nspecific to metamorphic stages of development. Moreover, these ESTs allowed\nidentification of a set of 225 polymorphic microsatellites that can be used as\ngenetic markers. These cDNA sequences permit in silico cloning of numerous\ngenes and will facilitate studies aimed at deciphering the roles of cognate\ngenes expressed in the nervous system during neural development and\nmetamorphosis. The genomic resources developed to study X. tropicalis biology\nwill accelerate exploration of amphibian physiology and genetics.\n",

        "abstract": "  Experimental variables of optical tweezers instrumentation that affect RNA\nfolding/unfolding kinetics were investigated. A model RNA hairpin, P5ab, was\nattached to two micron-sized beads through hybrid RNA/DNA handles; one bead was\ntrapped by dual-beam lasers and the other was held by a micropipette. Several\nexperimental variables were changed while measuring the unfolding/refolding\nkinetics, including handle lengths, trap stiffness, and modes of force applied\nto the molecule. In constant-force mode where the tension applied to the RNA\nwas maintained through feedback control, the measured rate coefficients varied\nwithin 40% when the handle lengths were changed by 10 fold (1.1 to 10.2 Kbp);\nthey increased by two- to three-fold when the trap stiffness was lowered to one\nthird (from 0.1 to 0.035 pN/nm). In the passive mode, without feedback control\nand where the force applied to the RNA varied in response to the end-to-end\ndistance change of the tether, the RNA hopped between a high-force folded-state\nand a low-force unfolded-state. In this mode, the rates increased up to\ntwo-fold with longer handles or softer traps. Overall, the measured rates\nremained with the same order-of-magnitude over the wide range of conditions\nstudied. In the companion paper (1), we analyze how the measured kinetics\nparameters differ from the intrinsic molecular rates of the RNA, and thus how\nto obtain the molecular rates.\n",

        "abstract": "  By exerting mechanical force it is possible to unfold/refold RNA molecules\none at a time. In a small range of forces, an RNA molecule can hop between the\nfolded and the unfolded state with force-dependent kinetic rates. Here, we\nintroduce a mesoscopic model to analyze the hopping kinetics of RNA hairpins in\nan optical tweezers setup. The model includes different elements of the\nexperimental setup (beads, handles and RNA sequence) and limitations of the\ninstrument (time lag of the force-feedback mechanism and finite bandwidth of\ndata acquisition). We investigated the influence of the instrument on the\nmeasured hopping rates. Results from the model are in good agreement with the\nexperiments reported in the companion article (1). The comparison between\ntheory and experiments allowed us to infer the values of the intrinsic\nmolecular rates of the RNA hairpin alone and to search for the optimal\nexperimental conditions to do the measurements. We conclude that long handles\nand soft laser traps represent the best conditions to extract rate estimates\nthat are closest to the intrinsic molecular rates. The methodology and\nrationale presented here can be applied to other experimental setups and other\nmolecules.\n",

(2005) can be accounted for by the\nspontaneity of DNA typical damages. These damages lead to replacements of\nguanine and cytosine by thymine. Part 2 proposes a hypothesis of the evolution\nof the genetic code, the leading mechanism of which is the nucleotide\nspontaneous damage. The hypothesis accounts for the universal trend of amino\nacid gain and loss, stability of the genetic code towards point mutations, the\npresence of code dialects, and the symmetry of the genetic code table.\n",

        "abstract": "  In birds, the link between parental care behaviour and prolactin release\nduring incubation persists after hatching in altricial birds, but has never\nbeen precisely studied during the whole rearing period in precocial species,\nsuch as ducks. The present study aims to understand how changes in parental\ncare after hatching are related to circulating prolactin levels in mallard hens\nrearing ducklings. Blood was sampled in hens over at least 13 post-hatching\nweeks and the behaviour of the hens and the ducklings was recorded daily until\nfledging. Contacts between hens and the ducklings, leadership of the ducklings\nand gathering of them steadily decreased over post-hatching time. Conversely,\nresting, preening and agonistic behaviour of hens towards ducklings increased.\nPlasma prolactin concentrations remained at high levels after hatching and then\nfell after week 6 when body mass and structural size of the young were close to\nthose of the hen. Parental care behaviour declined linearly with brood age,\nshowed a disruption of the hen-brood bond at week 6 post-hatching and was\nrelated to prolactin concentration according to a sigmoid function. Our results\nsuggest that a definite threshold in circulating prolactin is necessary to\npromote and/or to maintain post-hatching parental care in ducks.\n",

We describe a system of endothelial cells by means of\ntwo-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations of point-like particles. Cells'\nmotion is governed by the gradient of the concentration of a chemical substance\nthat they produce (chemotaxis). The typical time of degradation of the chemical\nsubstance introduces a characteristic length in the system. We show that\npoint-like model cells form network resembling structures tuned by this\ncharacteristic length, before collapsing altogether. Successively, we improve\nthe non-realistic point-like model cells by introducing an isotropic strong\nrepulsive force between them and a velocity dependent force mimicking the\nobserved peculiarity of endothelial cells to preserve the direction of their\nmotion (persistence). This more realistic model does not show a clear network\nformation. We ascribe this partial fault in reproducing the experiments to the\nstatic geometry of our model cells that, in reality, change their shapes by\nelongating toward neighboring cells.\n",

        "abstract": "  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common adult motor neuron\ndisease, causing motor neuron degeneration, muscle atrophy, paralysis, and\ndeath. Despite this degenerative process, a stable hypermetabolic state has\nbeen observed in a large subset of patients. Mice expressing a mutant form of\nCu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (mSOD1 mice) constitute an animal model of ALS that,\nlike patients, exhibits unexpectedly increased energy expenditure.\nCounterbalancing for this increase with a high-fat diet extends lifespan and\nprevents motor neuron loss. Here, we investigated whether lipid metabolism is\ndefective in this animal model. Hepatic lipid metabolism was roughly normal,\nwhereas gastrointestinal absorption of lipids as well as peripheral clearance\nof triglyceride-rich lipoproteins were markedly increased, leading to decreased\npostprandial lipidemia. This defect was corrected by the high-fat regimen that\ntypically induces neuroprotection in these animals. Together, our findings show\nthat energy metabolism in mSOD1 mice shifts toward an increase in the\nperipheral use of lipids. This metabolic shift probably accounts for the\nprotective effect of dietary lipids in this model.\n",

Here a network\nmodel is presented as an aid in understanding the role of social behavior and\nheterogeneous connectivity in determining the spatio-temporal patterns of\ndisease dynamics. We explore the controversial origins of long-term recurrent\noscillations believed to be characteristic to diseases that have a period of\ntemporary immunity after infection. In particular, we focus on sexually\ntransmitted diseases such as syphilis, where this controversy is currently\nunder review. Although temporary immunity plays a key role, it is found that in\nrealistic small-world networks, the social and sexual behavior of individuals\nalso has great influence in generating long-term cycles. The model generates\ncircular waves of infection with unusual spatial dynamics that depend on focal\nareas that act as pacemakers in the population. Eradication of the disease can\nbe efficiently achieved by eliminating the pacemakers with a targeted\nvaccination scheme. A simple difference equation model is derived, that\ncaptures the infection dynamics of the network model and gives insights into\ntheir origins and their eradication through vaccination.\n",

Metadynamics allows\nto overcome large energy barriers, whereas solute tempering improves the\nsampling with an affordable computational effort. From the sampled free-energy\nsurface we are able to reproduce a number of experimental observations, such as\nthe fact that the lowest minimum corresponds to a globular conformation\ndisplaying some degree of beta-structure, that the helical state is metastable\nand involves only 65% of the chain. The calculations also show that the system\npopulates consistently a pi-helix state and that the hydrophobic staple motif\nis present only in the free-energy minimum associated with the helices, and\ncontributes to their stabilization. The use of metadynamics coupled with solute\ntempering results then particularly suitable to provide the thermodynamics of a\nshort peptide, and its computational efficiency is promising to deal with\nlarger proteins.\n",

We find that, starting from any\nrandom network, reliability of the attractor landscape can often be achieved\nwith only few small changes to the network structure. Further, the evolvability\nof networks towards reliable dynamics while retaining their function is\ninvestigated and a high success rate is found.\n",

The precise\nmolecular mechanism of apoptosis signaling and how these two pathways are\ndifferentially activated under distinct apoptotic stimuli is poorly understood.\nWe developed a Monte Carlo-based stochastic simulation model that can\ncharacterize distinct signaling behaviors in the two major pathways of\napoptotic signaling using a novel probability distribution-based approach.\nSpecifically, we show that for a weak death signal, such as low levels of death\nligand Fas (CD95) binding or under stress conditions, the type 2 mitochondrial\npathway dominates apoptotic signaling. Our results also show signaling in the\ntype 2 pathway is stochastic, where the population average over many cells does\nnot capture the cell-to-cell fluctuations in the time course (~1 - 10 hours) of\ndownstream caspase-3 activation. On the contrary, the probability distribution\nof caspase-3 activation for the mitochondrial pathway shows a distinct bimodal\nbehavior that can be used to characterize the stochastic signaling in type 2\napoptosis. Interestingly, such stochastic fluctuations in apoptosis signaling\nhappen even in the presence of large numbers of signaling molecules. In a\nfluctuating environment, such stochasticity in the timecourse of caspase-3\nactivation may be an adaptive mechanism for allowing a competing survival\nsignal to win over a weak death trigger before the critical cell fate decision\nis made and thus minimizes the risk of pathologies.\n",

In this context, both data collection on sexual contact networks and\nthe modeling of disease spreading, are intensively contributing to the search\nfor effective immunization policies. Here, the spreading of sexually\ntransmitted diseases on bipartite scale-free graphs, representing heterosexual\ncontact networks, is considered. We analytically derive the expression for the\nepidemic threshold and its dependence with the system size in finite\npopulations. We show that the epidemic outbreak in bipartite populations, with\nnumber of sexual partners distributed as in empirical observations from\nnational sex surveys, takes place for larger spreading rates than for the case\nin which the bipartite nature of the network is not taken into account.\nNumerical simulations confirm the validity of the theoretical results. Our\nfindings indicate that the restriction to crossed infections between the two\nclasses of individuals (males and females) has to be taken into account in the\ndesign of efficient immunization strategies for sexually transmitted diseases.\n",

Conditions are identified that warrant the\nlargest impact of noise on the evolutionary process, and the results of Monte\nCarlo simulations are qualitatively reproduced by a four-point cluster\ndynamical mean-field approximation. The observed noise-guided evolution is\ndeeply routed in short-range spatial correlations, which is supported by\nsimulations on other host lattice topologies. Our findings are conceptually\nrelated to the coherence resonance phenomenon in dynamical systems via the\nmechanism of threshold duality. We also show that the introduced concept of\nnoise-guided evolution via the exploitation of threshold duality is not limited\nto predator-prey cyclical interactions, but may apply to models of evolutionary\ngame theory as well, thus indicating its applicability in several different\nfields of research.\n",

Regular arrays are extremely resilient and can reversibly\naccommodate a large amount of supercoiling without much change in length. This\nbehavior is quantitatively described by a molecular model of the chromatin 3-D\narchitecture. In this model, we assume the existence of a dynamic equilibrium\nbetween three conformations of the nucleosome, which are determined by the\ncrossing status of the entry/exit DNAs (positive, null or negative). Torsional\nstrain, in displacing that equilibrium, extensively reorganizes the fiber\narchitecture. The model explains a number of long-standing topological\nquestions regarding DNA in chromatin, and may provide the ground to better\nunderstand the dynamic binding of most chromatin-associated proteins.\n",

The twinness of a pair of nodes is the\nnumber of connected, labeled subgraphs of size n in which the two nodes possess\nidentical neighbours. The graph animal algorithm is used to estimate twinness\nfor each pair of nodes (for subgraph sizes n=4 to n=12) in four different\nprotein interaction networks (PINs). These include an Escherichia coli PIN and\nthree Saccharomyces cerevisiae PINs -- each obtained using state-of-the-art\nhigh throughput methods. In almost all cases, the average twinness of node\npairs is vastly higher than expected from a null model obtained by switching\nlinks. For all n, we observe a difference in the ratio of type A twins (which\nare unlinked pairs) to type B twins (which are linked pairs) distinguishing the\nprokaryote E. coli from the eukaryote S. cerevisiae. Interaction similarity is\nexpected due to gene duplication, and whole genome duplication paralogues in S.\ncerevisiae have been reported to co-cluster into the same complexes. Indeed, we\nfind that these paralogous proteins are over-represented as twins compared to\npairs chosen at random. These results indicate that twinness can detect\nancestral relationships from currently available PIN data.\n",

In this paper we show that, in fact, this tripartition\nmetric does not satisfy the separation axiom of distances (zero distance means\nisomorphism, or, in a more relaxed version, zero distance means\nindistinguishability in some specific sense) in any of the subclasses of\nphylogenetic networks where it is claimed to do so. We also present a subclass\nof phylogenetic networks whose members can be singled out by means of their\nsets of tripartitions (or even clusters), and hence where the latter can be\nused to define a meaningful metric.\n",

These problems arise from the infinite-sites\napproximation inherent in the PRF method. We introduce three new inference\ntechniques that correct these problems. We present a finite-site modification\nof the PRF method, as well as two new methods for inferring selection pressures\nand mutation rates based on diffusion models. Our methods can be used to infer\nnot only a \"weighted average\" of selection pressures acting on a gene sequence,\nbut also the distribution of selection pressures across sites. We evaluate the\naccuracy of our methods, as well that of the original PRF approach, by\ncomparison with Wright-Fisher simulations.\n",

We study the effect of sharing a reward among cooperators in the most\nstringent form of social dilemma, namely the Prisoner's Dilemma. Specifically,\nfor a group of players that collect payoffs by playing a pairwise Prisoner's\nDilemma game with their partners, we consider an external entity that\ndistributes a fixed reward equally among all cooperators. Thus, individuals\nconfront a new dilemma: on the one hand, they may be inclined to choose the\nshared reward despite the possibility of being exploited by defectors; on the\nother hand, if too many players do that, cooperators will obtain a poor reward\nand defectors will outperform them. By appropriately tuning the amount to be\nshared a vast variety of scenarios arises, including traditional ones in the\nstudy of cooperation as well as more complex situations where unexpected\nbehavior can occur. We provide a complete classification of the equilibria of\nthe $n$-player game as well as of its evolutionary dynamics.\n",

We characterize\nproperties of these cycles and their place in the regulatory mechanism of the\ncell. Almost all cycles in the transcription network of S. cerevisiae are\ncontained in a single strongly connected component, which we call LSCC (L for\n``largest''), except for a single cycle of two transcription factors. Among\ndifferent physiological conditions, cell cycle has the most significant\nrelationship with LSCC, as the set of 64 transcription interactions that are\nactive in all phases of the cell cycle has overlap of 27 with the interactions\nof LSCC (of which there are 49). Conversely, if we remove the interactions that\nare active in all phases of the cell cycle (fewer than 1% of the total), the\nLSCC would have only three nodes and 5 edges, 4 of which are active only in the\nstress response subnetwork. LSCC has a special place in the topology of the\nnetwork and it can be used to define a natural hierarchy in the network; in\nevery physiological subnetwork LSCC plays a pivotal role. Apart from those\nwell-defined conditions, the transcription network of S. cerevisiae is devoid\nof cycles. It was observed that two conditions that were studied and that have\nno cycles of their own are exogenous: diauxic shift and DNA repair, while cell\ncycle, sporulation are endogenous.\n",

They also showed that, unlike in the case of trees (i.e. level-0\nnetworks), the problem becomes NP-hard when the input is non-dense. Here we\nfurther extend this work by showing that, when the set of input triplets is\ndense, the problem is even polynomial-time solvable for the construction of\nlevel-2 networks. This shows that, assuming density, it is tractable to\nconstruct plausible evolutionary histories from input triplets even when such\nhistories are heavily non-tree like. This further strengthens the case for the\nuse of triplet-based methods in the construction of phylogenetic networks. We\nalso show that, in the non-dense case, the level-2 problem remains NP-hard.\n",

Each of these systems has its\ncharacteristic prime number used for construction of the related information\nspace. Relevance of this approach is illustrated by some examples. In\nparticular, it is shown that degeneration of the genetic code is a p-adic\nphenomenon. We have also put forward a hypothesis on evolution of the genetic\ncode assuming that primitive code was based on single nucleotides and\nchronologically first four amino acids. This formalism of p-adic genomic\ninformation systems can be implemented in computer programs and applied to\nvarious concrete cases.\n",

        "abstract": "  This paper studies the mutation-selection balance in three simplified\nreplication models. The first model considers a population of organisms\nreplicating via the production of asexual spores. The second model considers a\nsexually replicating population that produces identical gametes. The third\nmodel considers a sexually replicating population that produces distinct sperm\nand egg gametes. All models assume diploid organisms whose genomes consist of\ntwo chromosomes, each of which is taken to be functional if equal to some\nmaster sequence, and defective otherwise. In the asexual population, the\nasexual diploid spores develop directly into adult organisms. In the sexual\npopulations, the haploid gametes enter a haploid pool, where they may fuse with\nother haploids. The resulting immature diploid organisms then proceed to\ndevelop into mature organisms. Based on an analysis of all three models, we\nfind that, as organism size increases, a sexually replicating population can\nonly outcompete an asexually replicating population if the adult organisms\nproduce distinct sperm and egg gametes. A sexual replication strategy that is\nbased on the production of large numbers of sperm cells to fertilize a small\nnumber of eggs is found to be necessary in order to maintain a sufficiently low\ncost for sex for the strategy to be selected for over a purely asexual\nstrategy. We discuss the usefulness of this model in understanding the\nevolution and maintenance of sexual replication as the preferred replication\nstrategy in complex, multicellular organisms.\n",

        "abstract": "  In a recent article, Desai and Fisher (2007) proposed that the speed of\nadaptation in an asexual population is determined by the dynamics of the\nstochastic edge of the population, that is, by the emergence and subsequent\nestablishment of rare mutants that exceed the fitness of all sequences\ncurrently present in the population. Desai and Fisher perform an elaborate\nstochastic calculation of the mean time $\\tau$ until a new class of mutants has\nbeen established, and interpret $1/\\tau$ as the speed of adaptation. As they\nnote, however, their calculations are valid only for moderate speeds. This\nlimitation arises from their method to determine $\\tau$: Desai and Fisher\nback-extrapolate the value of $\\tau$ from the best-fit class' exponential\ngrowth at infinite time. This approach is not valid when the population adapts\nrapidly, because in this case the best-fit class grows non-exponentially during\nthe relevant time interval. Here, we substantially extend Desai and Fisher's\nanalysis of the stochastic edge. We show that we can apply Desai and Fisher's\nmethod to high speeds by either exponentially back-extrapolating from finite\ntime or using a non-exponential back-extrapolation. Our results are compatible\nwith predictions made using a different analytical approach (Rouzine et al.\n2003, 2007), and agree well with numerical simulations.\n",

        "abstract": "  We use traveling-wave theory to derive expressions for the rate of\naccumulation of deleterious mutations under Muller's ratchet and the speed of\nadaptation under positive selection in asexual populations. Traveling-wave\ntheory is a semi-deterministic description of an evolving population, where the\nbulk of the population is modeled using deterministic equations, but the class\nof the highest-fitness genotypes, whose evolution over time determines loss or\ngain of fitness in the population, is given proper stochastic treatment. We\nderive improved methods to model the highest-fitness class (the stochastic\nedge) for both Muller's ratchet and adaptive evolution, and calculate analytic\ncorrection terms that compensate for inaccuracies which arise when treating\ndiscrete fitness classes as a continuum. We show that traveling wave theory\nmakes excellent predictions for the rate of mutation accumulation in the case\nof Muller's ratchet, and makes good predictions for the speed of adaptation in\na very broad parameter range. We predict the adaptation rate to grow\nlogarithmically in the population size until the population size is extremely\nlarge.\n",

One of the mechanisms proposed to resolve this discrepancy is\ntermed \"intersegment transfer\". Many proteins have two DNA binding sites and\ncan transfer from one DNA segment to another without dissociation to water. We\ncalculate the target search rate for such proteins in a dense globular DNA,\ntaking into account intersegment transfer working in conjunction with DNA\nmotion and protein sliding along DNA. We show that intersegment transfer plays\na very important role in cases where the protein spends most of its time\nadsorbed on DNA.\n",

We find a super-linear increase of $K_c$ with\nthe (average) absolute threshold $|h|$, which approaches $K_c(|h|) \\sim\nh^2/(2\\ln{|h|})$ for large $|h|$, and show that this asymptotic scaling is\nuniversal for RTN with Poissonian distributed connectivity and threshold\ndistributions with a variance that grows slower than $h^2$. Interestingly, we\nfind that inhomogeneous distribution of thresholds leads to increased\npropagation of perturbations for sparsely connected networks, while for densely\nconnected networks damage is reduced; the cross-over point yields a novel,\ncharacteristic connectivity $K_d$, that has no counterpart in Boolean networks.\nLast, local correlations between node thresholds and in-degree are introduced.\nHere, numerical simulations show that even weak (anti-)correlations can lead to\na transition from ordered to chaotic dynamics, and vice versa. It is shown that\nthe naive mean-field assumption typical for the annealed approximation leads to\nfalse predictions in this case, since correlations between thresholds and\nout-degree that emerge as a side-effect strongly modify damage propagation\nbehavior.\n",

        "abstract": "  We conjecture that certain patterns (scars), theoretically and numerically\npredicted to be formed by electrons arranged on a sphere to minimize the\nrepulsive Coulomb potential (the Thomson problem) and experimentally found in\nspherical crystals formed by self-assembled polystyrene beads (an instance of\nthe generalized Thomson problem), could be relevant to extend the classic\nCaspar and Klug construction for icosahedrally-shaped virus capsids. The main\nidea is that scars could be produced at an intermediate stage of the assembly\nof the virus capsids and the release of the bending energy present in scars\ninto stretching energy could allow for a variety of non-spherical capsids'\nshapes. The conjecture can be tested in experiments on the assembly of\nartificial protein-cages where these scars should appear.\n",

The results of this paper explain the findings\non the numbers of arcs of RNA secondary structures obtained by molecular\nfolding algorithms and predict the distributions for k-noncrossing RNA folding\nalgorithms which are currently being developed.\n",

In such cells\n(models), typified by the quadratic integrate and fire model, mutual synaptic\ncoupling can cause sustained firing or oscillatory behavior which is\nnecessarily antiphase. Additive Gaussian white noise can transiently terminate\nthe oscillations, hence destroying the stable limit cycle. Further application\nof the noise may return the system to spiking activity. In a particular noise\nrange, the transition times between the oscillating and the resting state are\nstrongly asymmetric. We numerically investigate an approximate basin of\nattraction, A, of the periodic orbit and use Markov process theory to explain\nthe firing behavior in terms of the probability of escape of trajectories from\nA\n",

We particularly\nfocalize on our model requirements which allows us to re-create some drastic\npathological characteristics experienced by severely head-injured patients:\nimpact on a closed skull, no ventilation immediately after impact, presence of\ndiffuse axonal injuries and secondary brain insults from systemic origin...We\nnotably give priority to minimize anaesthesia duration in order to tend to\nbanish any neuroprotection. Our new model will henceforth allow a better\nunderstanding of neurochemical and biochemical alterations resulting from\ntraumatic brain injury, using microdialysis and PtiO2 techniques already\nmonitored in our Intensive Care Unit.

        "abstract": "  Eytan and Marom recently showed that the spontaneous burst activity of rat\nneuron cultures includes `first to fire' cells that consistently fire earlier\nthan others. Here we analyze the behavior of these neurons in long term\nrecordings of spontaneous activity of rat hippocampal and rat cortical neuron\ncultures from three different laboratories. We identify precursor events that\nmay either subside (`small events') or can lead to a full-blown burst\n(`pre-bursts'). We find that the activation in the pre-burst typically has a\nfirst neuron (`leader'), followed by a localized response in its neighborhood.\nLocality is diminished in the bursts themselves. The long term dynamics of the\nleaders is relatively robust, evolving with a half-life of 23-34 hours.\nStimulation of the culture can temporarily alter the leader distribution, but\nit returns to the previous distribution within about 1 hour. We show that the\nleaders carry information about the identity of the burst, as measured by the\nsignature of the number of spikes per neuron in a burst. The number of spikes\nfrom leaders in the first few spikes of a precursor event is furthermore shown\nto be predictive with regard to the transition into a burst (pre-burst versus\nsmall event). We conclude that the leaders play a r\\^ole in the development of\nthe bursts, and conjecture that they are part of an underlying sub-network that\nis excited first and then act as nucleation centers for the burst.\n",

A\ncomparison with the response of fibers of tetrasomes (the (H3-H4)2 tetramer\nbound with ~50 bp of DNA) obtained by depletion of H2A-H2B dimers, suggests\nthat the trapping reflects a nucleosome chiral transition to a metastable form\nbuilt on the previously documented righthanded tetrasome.

        "abstract": "  Support vector machines and kernel methods have recently gained considerable\nattention in chemoinformatics. They offer generally good performance for\nproblems of supervised classification or regression, and provide a flexible and\ncomputationally efficient framework to include relevant information and prior\nknowledge about the data and problems to be handled. In particular, with kernel\nmethods molecules do not need to be represented and stored explicitly as\nvectors or fingerprints, but only to be compared to each other through a\ncomparison function technically called a kernel. While classical kernels can be\nused to compare vector or fingerprint representations of molecules, completely\nnew kernels were developed in the recent years to directly compare the 2D or 3D\nstructures of molecules, without the need for an explicit vectorization step\nthrough the extraction of molecular descriptors. While still in their infancy,\nthese approaches have already demonstrated their relevance on several toxicity\nprediction and structure-activity relationship problems.\n",

        "abstract": "  Several studies suggest that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 plays a pivotal role in\nthe progression of ischaemic brain damage. In the present study, we\ninvestigated the effects of selective inhibition of COX-2 with nimesulide (12\nmg/kg) and selective inhibition of COX-1 with valeryl salicylate (VAS, 12-120\nmg/kg) on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, Evans\nblue (EB) extravasation and infarct volume in a standardized model of transient\nfocal cerebral ischaemia in the rat. Post-ischaemic treatment with nimesulide\nmarkedly reduced the increase in PGE2 levels in the ischaemic cerebral cortex\n24 h after stroke and diminished infarct size by 48% with respect to\nvehicle-treated animals after 3 days of reperfusion. Furthermore, nimesulide\nsignificantly attenuated the blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage and leukocyte\ninfiltration (as measured by EB leakage and MPO activity, respectively) seen at\n48 h after the initial ischaemic episode. These studies provide the first\nexperimental evidence that COX-2 inhibition with nimesulide is able to limit\nBBB disruption and leukocyte infiltration following transient focal cerebral\nischaemia. Neuroprotection afforded by nimesulide is observed even when the\ntreatment is delayed until 6 h after the onset of ischaemia, confirming a wide\ntherapeutic window of COX-2 inhibitors in experimental stroke. On the contrary,\nselective inhibition of COX-1 with VAS had no significant effect on the\nevaluated parameters. These data suggest that COX-2 activity, but not COX-1\nactivity, contributes to the progression of focal ischaemic brain injury, and\nthat the beneficial effects observed with non-selective COX inhibitors are\nprobably associated to COX-2 rather than to COX-1 inhibition.\n",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate\nthe neuroprotective effects of the selective COX-2 inhibitor nimesulide on\ncerebral infarction and neurological deficits in a standardized model of\ntransient focal cerebral ischemia in rats. Three doses of nimesulide (3, 6 and\n12 mg/kg; i.p.) or vehicle were administered immediately after stroke and\nadditional doses were given at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h after ischemia. In other\nset of experiments, the effect of nimesulide was studied in a situation in\nwhich its first administration was delayed for 3-24 h after ischemia. Total,\ncortical and subcortical infarct volumes and functional outcome (assessed by\nneurological deficit score and rotarod performance) were determined 3 days\nafter ischemia. The effect of nimesulide on prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) levels\nin the injured brain was also investigated. Nimesulide dose-dependently reduced\ninfarct volume and improved functional recovery when compared to vehicle. Of\ninterest is the finding that neuroprotection conferred by nimesulide (reduction\nof infarct size and neurological deficits and improvement of rotarod\nperformance) was also observed when treatment was delayed until 24 h after\nischemia. Further, administration of nimesulide in a delayed treatment paradigm\ncompletely abolished PGE(2) accumulation in the postischemic brain, suggesting\nthat COX-2 inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy for cerebral ischemia\nto target the late-occurring inflammatory events which amplify initial damage.\n",

        "abstract": "  Theoretical analysis of own and literature investigations of sexual\nmotivation with the use of the partition test [Kudryavtseva, 1987, 1994] in\nmale mice was carried out. It has been shown that appearance of a receptive\nfemale in the neighboring compartment of common cage separated by perforated\ntransparent partition produces the enhancement of testosterone level in blood\nand stimulates the behavioral activity near partition as a reaction to the\nreceptive female in naive males. In many studies this behavioral activity is\nconsidered as sexual motivation, arising in this experimental context in male\nmice. The lack of correlation between behavioral parameters and gonad reaction\nof males on receptive female, uninterconnected changes of these two parameters\nas well as the lack of sexual behavior between naive male and female when\npartition is removed cast doubt on this data interpretation. It has been\nsupposed that in naive males behavioral reaction to a receptive female is\ninduced by positive incentive - odor of the female associated with nursing and\nwarmth from mother and other females which look after posterity. Short-term\nincrease of the level of testosterone (possessing rewarding properties) is\ninnate stimulus-response reaction which stimulates and prolongs behavioral\ninterest of male to receptive female. It has been supposed that after sexual\nexperience female odor is associated in experienced males with sexual behavior\ndirected to the sexual partner and resulted in the formation of sexual\nmotivation. The data are considered also in the light of the theory of\nmotivated behavior including \"liking\", \"wanting\" and \"learning\" [Robinson and\nBerridge, 1993, 2000].\n",

        "abstract": "  Recently, several studies have investigated the transcription process\nassociated to specific genetic regulatory networks. In this work, we present a\nstochastic approach for analyzing the dynamics and effect of negative feedback\nloops (FBL) on the transcriptional noise. First, our analysis allows us to\nidentify a bimodal activity depending of the strength of self-repression\ncoupling D. In the strong coupling region D>>1, the variance of the\ntranscriptional noise is found to be reduced a 28 % more than described\nearlier. Secondly, the contribution of the noise effect to the abundance of\nregulating protein becomes manifest when the coefficient of variation is\ncomputed. In the strong coupling region, this coefficient is found to be\nindependent of all parameters and in fair agreement with the experimentally\nobserved values. Finally, our analysis reveals that the regulating protein is\nsignificantly induced by the intrinsic and external noise in the strong\ncoupling region. In short, it indicates that the existence of inherent noise in\nFBL makes it possible to produce a basal amount of proteins even though the\nrepression level D is very strong.\n",

Using\nthese trajectories, we examine the relaxation behavior, secondary structure\nformation, and transition-state ensembles (TSEs) of the two proteins and\ncompare our results with experimental data and previous computational studies.\nTo obtain a detailed structural information on the folding dynamics viewed as\nan ensemble process, we perform a clustering analysis procedure based on graph\ntheory. Moreover, rigorous pfold analysis is used to obtain representative\nsamples of the TSEs and a good quantitative agreement between experimental and\nsimulated Fi-values is obtained for protein A. Fi-values for Villin are also\nobtained and left as predictions to be tested by future experiments. Our\nanalysis shows that two-helix hairpin is a common partially stable structural\nmotif that gets formed prior to entering the TSE in the studied proteins. These\nresults together with our earlier study of Engrailed Homeodomain and recent\nexperimental studies provide a comprehensive, atomic-level picture of folding\nmechanics of three-helix bundle proteins.\n",

This information allows researchers to perform association\nstudies for the genetic variants involved in diseases and the individual\nresponses to therapeutic agents.\n  A notable approach to the problem is to encode it as a combinatorial problem\n(under certain hypotheses, such as the pure parsimony criterion) and to solve\nit using off-the-shelf combinatorial optimization techniques. The main methods\napplied to Haplotype Inference are either simple greedy heuristic or exact\nmethods (Integer Linear Programming, Semidefinite Programming, SAT encoding)\nthat, at present, are adequate only for moderate size instances.\n  We believe that metaheuristic and hybrid approaches could provide a better\nscalability. Moreover, metaheuristics can be very easily combined with problem\nspecific heuristics and they can also be integrated with tree-based search\ntechniques, thus providing a promising framework for hybrid systems in which a\ngood trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency can be reached.\n  In this paper we illustrate a feasibility study of the approach and discuss\nsome relevant design issues, such as modeling and design of approximate solvers\nthat combine constructive heuristics, local search-based improvement strategies\nand learning mechanisms. Besides the relevance of the Haplotype Inference\nproblem itself, this preliminary analysis is also an interesting case study\nbecause the formulation of the problem poses some challenges in modeling and\nhybrid metaheuristic solver design that can be generalized to other problems.\n",

Furthermore, in combination with aspirin, ascorbic acid\naugmented the inhibitory effect of aspirin on PGE2 synthesis. However, ascorbic\nacid had no synergistic effect along with other COX inhibitors (SC-58125 and\nindomethacin). The inhibition of IL-1beta-mediated PGE2 synthesis by ascorbic\nacid was not due to the inhibition of the expression of COX-2 or microsomal\nprostaglandin E synthase (mPGES-1). Rather, ascorbic acid dose-dependently\n(0.1-100 microM) produced a significant reduction in IL-1beta-mediated\nproduction of 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha (8-iso-PGF2alpha), a reliable\nindicator of free radical formation, suggesting that the effects of ascorbic\nacid on COX-2-mediated PGE2 biosynthesis may be the result of the maintenance\nof the neuronal redox status since COX activity is known to be enhanced by\noxidative stress. Our results provide in vitro evidence that the\nneuroprotective effects of ascorbic acid may depend, at least in part, on its\nability to reduce neuronal COX-2 activity and PGE2 synthesis, owing to its\nantioxidant properties. Further, these experiments suggest that a combination\nof aspirin with ascorbic acid constitutes a novel approach to render COX-2 more\nsensitive to inhibition by aspirin, allowing an anti-inflammatory therapy with\nlower doses of aspirin, thereby avoiding the side effects of the usually high\ndose aspirin treatment.\n",

        "abstract": "  In the present study, we show that ascorbic acid dose-dependently inhibited\ninterleukin-1beta (IL-1beta)-mediated PGE2 synthesis in the human neuronal cell\nline, SK-N-SH. Furthermore, in combination with aspirin, ascorbic acid\naugmented the inhibitory effect of aspirin on PGE2 synthesis. However, ascorbic\nacid had no synergistic effect along with other COX inhibitors (SC-58125 and\nindomethacin). The inhibition of IL-1beta-mediated PGE2 synthesis by ascorbic\nacid was not due to the inhibition of the expression of COX-2 or microsomal\nprostaglandin E synthase (mPGES-1). Rather, ascorbic acid dose-dependently\n(0.1-100 microM) produced a significant reduction in IL-1beta-mediated\nproduction of 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha (8-iso-PGF2alpha), a reliable\nindicator of free radical formation, suggesting that the effects of ascorbic\nacid on COX-2-mediated PGE2 biosynthesis may be the result of the maintenance\nof the neuronal redox status since COX activity is known to be enhanced by\noxidative stress. Our results provide in vitro evidence that the\nneuroprotective effects of ascorbic acid may depend, at least in part, on its\nability to reduce neuronal COX-2 activity and PGE2 synthesis, owing to its\nantioxidant properties. Further, these experiments suggest that a combination\nof aspirin with ascorbic acid constitutes a novel approach to render COX-2 more\nsensitive to inhibition by aspirin, allowing an anti-inflammatory therapy with\nlower doses of aspirin, thereby avoiding the side effects of the usually high\ndose aspirin treatment.\n",

From the\nperspective of physicists, an RNAP is a molecular motor that utilizes chemical\nenergy input to move along the track formed by a DNA. In many circumstances,\nwhich are described in this paper, a large number of RNAPs move simultaneously\nalong the same track; we refer to such collective movements of the RNAPs as\nRNAP traffic. Here we develop a theoretical model for RNAP traffic by\nincorporating the steric interactions between RNAPs as well as the\nmechano-chemical cycle of individual RNAPs during the elongation of the mRNA.\nBy a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, we calculate the rates\nof mRNA synthesis and the average density profile of the RNAPs on the DNA\ntrack. We also introduce, and compute, two new measures of fluctuations in the\nsynthesis of RNA. Analyzing these fluctuations, we show how the level of {\\it\nintrinsic noise} in mRNA synthesis depends on the concentrations of the RNAPs\nas well as on those of some of the reactants and the products of the enzymatic\nreactions catalyzed by RNAP. We suggest appropriate experimental systems and\ntechniques for testing our theoretical predictions.\n",

        "abstract": "  Strong experimental and theoretical evidence shows that transcription factors\nand other specific DNA-binding proteins find their sites using a two-mode\nsearch: alternating between 3D diffusion through the cell and 1D sliding along\nthe DNA. We consider the role spatial effects in the mechanism on two different\nscales. First, we reconcile recent experimental findings by showing that the 3D\ndiffusion of the transcription factor is often local, i.e. the transcription\nfactor lands quite near its dissociation site. Second, we discriminate between\ntwo types of searches: global searches and local searches. We show that these\nsearches differ significantly in average search time and the variability of\nsearch time. Using experimentally measured parameter values, we also show that\n1D and 3D search is not optimally balanced, leading to much larger estimates of\nsearch time. Together, these results lead to a number of biological\nimplications including suggestions of how prokaryotes and eukaryotes achieve\nrapid gene regulation and the relationship between the search mechanism and\nnoise in gene expression.\n",

For any $p < 1$, we find spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking into a new class of self-organized networks, characterized by a much\nhigher average connectivity $\\bar{K}_{evo}$ than networks without threshold\nadaptation ($p =1$). While $\\bar{K}_{evo}$ and evolved out-degree distributions\nare independent from $p$ for $p <1$, in-degree distributions become broader\nwhen $p \\to 1$, approaching a power-law. In this limit, time scale separation\nbetween threshold adaptions and rewiring also leads to strong correlations\nbetween thresholds and in-degree. Finally, evidence is presented that networks\nconverge to self-organized criticality for large $N$.\n",

        "abstract": "  The diversity in wealth and social status is present not only among humans,\nbut throughout the animal world. We account for this observation by generating\nrandom variables that determ ine the social diversity of players engaging in\nthe prisoner's dilemma game. Here the term social diversity is used to address\nextrinsic factors that determine the mapping of game pay offs to individual\nfitness. These factors may increase or decrease the fitness of a player\ndepending on its location on the spatial grid. We consider different\ndistributions of extrin sic factors that determine the social diversity of\nplayers, and find that the power-law distribution enables the best promotion of\ncooperation. The facilitation of the cooperative str ategy relies mostly on the\ninhomogeneous social state of players, resulting in the formation of\ncooperative clusters which are ruled by socially high-ranking players that are\nable to prevail against the defectors even when there is a large temptation to\ndefect. To confirm this, we also study the impact of spatially correlated\nsocial diversity and find that coopera tion deteriorates as the spatial\ncorrelation length increases. Our results suggest that the distribution of\nwealth and social status might have played a crucial role by the evolution of\ncooperation amongst egoistic individuals.\n",

In particular, we quantitatively analyzed the motion of\nC. elegans with defective synaptic GABA and acetylcholine transmission,\ndefective muscle calcium signaling, and defective muscles and cuticle\nstructures, and compared the data with our systems level circuit model. The\nmajor experimental findings are: (i) anterior-to-posterior gradients of body\nbending flex for almost all strains both for forward and backward motion, and\nfor neuronal mutants, also analogous weak gradients of undulatory frequency,\n(ii) existence of some form of neuromuscular (stretch receptor) feedback, (iii)\ninvariance of neuromuscular wavelength, (iv) biphasic dependence of frequency\non synaptic signaling, and (v) decrease of frequency with increase of the\nmuscle time constant. Based on (i) we hypothesize that the Central Pattern\nGenerator (CPG) is located in the head both for forward and backward motion.\nPoints (i) and (ii) are the starting assumptions for our theoretical model,\nwhose dynamical patterns are qualitatively insensitive to the details of the\nCPG design if stretch receptor feedback is sufficiently strong and slow. The\nmodel reveals that stretch receptor coupling in the body wall is critical for\ngeneration of the neuromuscular wave. Our model agrees with our behavioral\ndata(iii), (iv), and (v), and with other pertinent published data, e.g., that\nfrequency is an increasing function of muscle gap-junction coupling.\n",

        "abstract": "  Filamentous phage, such as fd used in this study, are thread-shaped bacterial\nviruses. Their outer coat is a tube formed by thousands equal copies of the\nmajor coat protein pVIII. We constructed libraries of random peptides fused to\nall pVIII domains and selected phages that act as probes specific for a panel\nof test antigens and biological threat agents. Because the viral carrier is\ninfective, phage borne bio-selective probes can be cloned individually and\npropagated indefinitely without needs of their chemical synthesis or\nreconstructing. We demonstrated the feasibility of using landscape phages and\ntheir stripped fusion proteins as new bioselective materials that combine\nunique characteristics of affinity reagents and self assembling membrane\nproteins. Biorecognition layers fabricated from phage-derived probes bind\nbiological agents and generate detectable signals. The performance of\nphage-derived materials as biorecognition films was illustrated by detection of\nstreptavidin-coated beads, Bacillus anthracis spores and Salmonella typhimurium\ncells. With further refinement, the phage-derived analytical platforms for\ndetecting and monitoring of numerous threat agents may be developed, since the\nbiodetector films may be obtained from landscape phages selected against any\nbacteria, virus or toxin. As elements of field-use detectors, they are superior\nto antibodies, since they are inexpensive, highly specific and strong binders,\nresistant to high temperatures and environmental stresses.\n",

Molecular communication is a new communication paradigm where\nbiological and artificially-created nanomachines communicate over a short\ndistance using molecules. A molecular propagation system in molecular\ncommunication directionally transports molecules from a sender to a receiver.\nIn the design described in this paper, protein filaments glide over immobilized\nmotor proteins along preconfigured microlithographic tracks, and the gliding\nprotein filaments carry and transport molecules from a sender to a receiver. In\nthe design, DNA hybridization is used to load and unload the molecules onto and\nfrom the carriers at a sender and a receiver. In the design,\nloading/transporting/unloading processes are autonomous and require no external\ncontrol.\n",

One key virtue of statistical mechanics is that it is\ndesigned to examine large systems with many interacting degrees of freedom,\nproviding a clue that it might have some bearing on the analysis of the\nmolecules of living matter. As a result of data on biological systems becoming\nincreasingly quantitative, there is a concomitant demand that the models set\nforth to describe biological systems be themselves quantitative. We describe\nhow statistical mechanics is part of the quantitative toolkit that is needed to\nrespond to such data. The power of statistical mechanics is not limited to\ntraditional physical and chemical problems and there are a host of interesting\nways in which these ideas can be applied in biology. This article reports on\nour efforts to teach statistical mechanics to life science students and\nprovides a framework for others interested in bringing these tools to a\nnontraditional audience in the life sciences.\n",

First mode\nrelaxation times were extracted from the mean square displacement in the\ntransverse coordinate. For microtubules shorter than 10 um, the relaxation\ntimes were found to follow an L^2 dependence instead of L^4 as expected from\nthe standard wormlike chain model. This length dependence is shown to result\nfrom a complex length dependence of the bending stiffness which can be\nunderstood as a result of the molecular architecture of microtubules.

        "abstract": "  The very insightful Trivers-Willard hypothesis, proposed in the early 1970s,\nstates that females in good physiological conditions are more likely to produce\nmale offspring, when the variance of reproductive success amongst males is\nhigh. A number of studies, aimed at its experimental verification, have found\nadequate supportive evidence in its favour. Theoretical investigations,\nhowever, have been few, perhaps because formulating a population-genetic model\nfor describing the Trivers-Willard hypothesis turns out to be surprisingly\ncomplex. The present study describes a minimal population genetic model to\nexplore one specific scenario, viz. how is the preference for a male offspring\nby females in good condition altered when 'g', the proportion of such females\nin the population changes from a low to a high value. As expected, when the\nproportion of such females is low, i.e., for low values of 'g', the\nTrivers-Willard (TW) strategy goes to fixation against the equal investment\nstrategy. This holds true up to gmax, a critical value of 'g', above which the\ntwo strategies coexist, but the proportion of the TW strategy steadily\ndecreases as 'g' increases to unity. Similarly, when the effect of well-endowed\nmales attaining disproportionately high number of matings is more pronounced,\nthe TW strategy is more likely to go to fixation. Interestingly, the success of\nthe TW strategy has a complex dependence on the variance in the physiological\ncondition of females. If the difference in the two types of conditions is not\nlarge, TW strategy is favoured, and its success is more likely as the\ndifference increases. However, beyond a critical value of the difference, the\nTW strategy is found to be less and less likely to succeed as the difference\nbecomes larger. Possible reasons for these effects are discussed.\n",

The system consists of dendrimers conjugated with \"keys\" (ex:\nfolic acid) which \"key-lock\" bind to particular cell membrane proteins (ex:\nfolate receptor). The increased concentration of \"locks\" on the surface leads\nto a longer residence time for the dendrimer and greater incorporation into the\ncell. Cooperative binding of the nanocomplexes leads to an enhancement of cell\nspecificity. However, both our theory and detailed analysis of in-vitro\nexperiments indicate that the degree of cooperativity is kinetically limited.\nWe demonstrate that cooperativity and hence the specificity to particular cell\ntype can be increased by making the strength of individual bonds weaker, and\nsuggest a particular implementation of this idea. The implications of the work\nfor optimizing the design of drug delivery vehicles are discussed.\n",

        "abstract": "  A model is presented to describe the nucleotide and repeat addition\nprocessivity by the telomerase. In the model, the processive nucleotide\naddition is implemented on the basis of two requirements: One is that stem IV\nloop stimulates the chemical reaction of nucleotide incorporation, and the\nother one is the existence of an ssRNA-binding site adjacent to the polymerase\nsite that has a high affinity for the unpaired base of the template. The\nunpairing of DNA:RNA hybrid after the incorporation of the nucleotide paired\nwith the last base on the template, which is the prerequisite for repeat\naddition processivity, is caused by a force acting on the primer. The force is\nresulted from the unfolding of stem III pseudoknot that is induced by the\nswinging of stem IV loop towards the nucleotide-bound polymerase site. Based on\nthe model, the dynamics of processive nucleotide and repeat additions by\nTetrahymena telomerase are quantitatively studied, which give good explanations\nto the previous experimental results. Moreover, some predictions are presented.\nIn particular, it is predicted that the repeat addition processivity is mainly\ndetermined by the difference between the free energy required to disrupt the\nDNA:RNA hybrid and that required to unfold the stem III pseudoknot, with the\nlarge difference corresponding to a low repeat addition processivity while the\nsmall one corresponding to a high repeat addition processivity.\n",

        "abstract": "  The critical properties of the Frank model of spontaneous chiral synthesis\nare discussed by applying results from the field theoretic renormalization\ngroup (RG). The long time and long wavelength features of this microscopic\nreaction scheme belong to the same universality class as multi-colored directed\npercolation processes. Thus, the following RG fixed points (FP) govern the\ncritical dynamics of the Frank model for d<4: one unstable FP that corresponds\nto complete decoupling between the two enantiomers, a saddle-point that\ncorresponds to symmetric interspecies coupling, and two stable FPs that\nindividually correspond to unidirectional couplings between the two chiral\nmolecules. These latter two FPs are associated with the breakdown of mirror or\nchiral symmetry. In this simplified model of molecular synthesis, homochirality\nis a natural consequence of the intrinsic reaction noise in the critical\nregime, which corresponds to extremely dilute chemical systems.\n",

        "abstract": "  Cooperation plays a key role in the evolution of complex systems. However,\nthe level of cooperation extensively varies with the topology of agent networks\nin the widely used models of repeated games. Here we show that cooperation\nremains rather stable by applying the reinforcement learning strategy adoption\nrule, Q-learning on a variety of random, regular, small-word, scale-free and\nmodular network models in repeated, multi-agent Prisoners Dilemma and Hawk-Dove\ngames. Furthermore, we found that using the above model systems other long-term\nlearning strategy adoption rules also promote cooperation, while introducing a\nlow level of noise (as a model of innovation) to the strategy adoption rules\nmakes the level of cooperation less dependent on the actual network topology.\nOur results demonstrate that long-term learning and random elements in the\nstrategy adoption rules, when acting together, extend the range of network\ntopologies enabling the development of cooperation at a wider range of costs\nand temptations. These results suggest that a balanced duo of learning and\ninnovation may help to preserve cooperation during the re-organization of\nreal-world networks, and may play a prominent role in the evolution of\nself-organizing, complex systems.\n",

        "abstract": "  With the continued improvement of sequencing technologies, the prospect of\ngenome-based medicine is now at the forefront of scientific research. To\nrealize this potential, however, we need a revolutionary sequencing method for\nthe cost-effective and rapid interrogation of individual genomes. This\ncapability is likely to be provided by a physical approach to probing DNA at\nthe single nucleotide level. This is in sharp contrast to current techniques\nand instruments which probe, through chemical elongation, electrophoresis, and\noptical detection, length differences and terminating bases of strands of DNA.\nIn this Colloquium we review several physical approaches to DNA detection that\nhave the potential to deliver fast and low-cost sequencing. Center-fold to\nthese approaches is the concept of nanochannels or nanopores which allow for\nthe spatial confinement of DNA molecules. In addition to their possible impact\nin medicine and biology, the methods offer ideal test beds to study open\nscientific issues and challenges in the relatively unexplored area at the\ninterface between solids, liquids, and biomolecules at the nanometer length\nscale. We emphasize the physics behind these methods and ideas, critically\ndescribe their advantages and drawbacks, and discuss future research\nopportunities in this field.\n",

The key point is the definition of a distance among\nall pairs of languages which is the analogous of a genetic distance. Many\nmethods have been proposed to define these distances, one of this, used by\nglottochronology, compute distance from the percentage of shared ``cognates''.\nCognates are words inferred to have a common historical origin, and subjective\njudgment plays a relevant role in the identification process. Here we push\ncloser the analogy with evolutionary biology and we introduce a genetic\ndistance among language pairs by considering a renormalized Levenshtein\ndistance among words with same meaning and averaging on all the words contained\nin a Swadesh list \\cite{Sw}. The subjectivity of process is consistently\nreduced and the reproducibility is highly facilitated. We test our method\nagainst the Indo-European group considering fifty different languages and the\ntwo hundred words of the Swadesh list for any of them. We find out a tree which\nclosely resembles the one published in \\cite{GA} with some significant\ndifferences.\n",

Inspired by them, in this paper we simulated the splitting of a\nsingle species into two separate ones via random mutations, with both\npopulations living together in sympatry, sharing the same habitat. We study the\necological, mating and genetic conditions needed to reproduce the\npolychromatism and polymorphism of three species of the Midas Cichlid species\ncomplex. Our results show two scenarios for the A. Citrinellus speciation\nprocess, one with and the other without disruptive natural selection. In the\nfirst scenario, the ecological and genetic conditions are sufficient to create\ntwo new species, while in the second the mating and genetic conditions must be\nsynchronized in order to control the velocity of genetic drift.\n",

        "abstract": "  The p53 protein is well-known for its tumour suppressor function. The\np53-MDM2 negative feedback loop constitutes the core module of a network of\nregulatory interactions activated under cellular stress. In normal cells, the\nlevel of p53 proteins is kept low by MDM2, i.e. MDM2 negatively regulates the\nactivity of p53. In the case of DNA damage,the p53-mediated pathways are\nactivated leading to cell cycle arrest and repair of the DNA. If repair is not\npossible due to excessive damage, the p53-mediated apoptotic pathway is\nactivated bringing about cell death. In this paper, we give an overview of our\nstudies on the p53-MDM2 module and the associated pathways from a systems\nbiology perspective. We discuss a number of key predictions, related to some\nspecific aspects of cell cycle arrest and cell death, which could be tested in\nexperiments.\n",

The model is inspired by the lesion structures observed\nin the case of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a chronic disease of the CNS. The\ninitial lesion site is at the center of a unit square and spreads outwards\nbased on the success rate in damaging edges (axons) of the network. The damaged\nedges send out alarm signals which, at appropriate intensity levels, generate\nprogrammed cell death. Depending on the extent and timing of the programmed\ncell death, the lesion may get controlled or aggravated akin to the control of\nwild fires by burning of peripheral vegetation. The parameter phase space of\nthe model shows smooth transition from uncontrolled situation to controlled\nsituation. The simulations show that the model is capable of generating a wide\nvariety of lesion growth and arrest scenarios.\n",

In this paper, we present and study a\nnew class of phylogenetic networks, called tree-child phylogenetic networks,\nwhere every non-extant species has some descendant through mutation. We provide\nan injective representation of these networks as multisets of vectors of\nnatural numbers, their path multiplicity vectors, and we use this\nrepresentation to define a distance on this class and to give an alignment\nmethod for pairs of these networks. To the best of our knowledge, they are\nrespectively the first true distance and the first alignment method defined on\na meaningful class of phylogenetic networks strictly extending the class of\nphylogenetic trees. Simple, polynomial algorithms for reconstructing a\ntree-child phylogenetic network from its path multiplicity vectors, for\ncomputing the distance between two tree-child phylogenetic networks, and for\naligning a pair of tree-child phylogenetic networks, are provided, and they\nhave been implemented as a Perl package and a Java applet, and they are\navailable at http://bioinfo.uib.es/~recerca/phylonetworks/mudistance\n",

        "abstract": "  Push-pull networks are ubiquitous in signal transduction pathways in both\nprokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. They allow cells to strongly amplify signals\nvia the mechanism of zero-order ultrasensitivity. In a push-pull network, two\nantagonistic enzymes control the activity of a protein by covalent\nmodification. These enzymes are often uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm.\nThey can, however, also be colocalized in space, for instance, near the pole of\nthe cell. Moreover, it is increasingly recognized that these enzymes can also\nbe spatially separated, leading to gradients of the active form of the\nmessenger protein. Here, we investigate the consequences of the spatial\ndistributions of the enzymes for the amplification properties of push-pull\nnetworks. Our calculations reveal that enzyme localization by itself can have a\ndramatic effect on the gain. The gain is maximized when the two enzymes are\neither uniformly distributed or colocalized in one region in the cell.\nDepending on the diffusion constants, however, the sharpness of the response\ncan be strongly reduced when the enzymes are spatially separated. We discuss\nhow our predictions could be tested experimentally.\n",

We allow various interactions between chemically unbonded\nresidues in a given sequence and the solvent (water), and exactly enumerate the\nnumber of conformations W(E) as a function of the energy E on an infinite\nlattice under two different conditions: (i) we allow conformations that are\nrestricted to be compact (known as Hamilton walk conformations), and (ii) we\nallow unrestricted conformations that can also be non-compact. It is easily\ndemonstrated using plausible arguments that our model does not possess any\nenergy gap even though it is supposed to exhibit a sharp folding transition in\nthe thermodynamic limit. The enumeration allows us to investigate exactly the\neffects of energetics on the native state(s), and the effect of small size on\nprotein thermodynamics and, in particular, on the differences between the\nmicrocanonical and canonical ensembles. We find that the canonical entropy is\nmuch larger than the microcanonical entropy for finite systems. We investigate\nthe property of self-averaging and conclude that small proteins do not\nself-average. We also present results that (i) provide some understanding of\nthe energy landscape, and (ii) shed light on the free energy landscape at\ndifferent temperatures.\n",

        "abstract": "  The effects of demographic stochasticity in the long term behaviour of\nendemic infectious diseases have been considered for long as a necessary\naddition to an underlying deterministic theory. The latter would explain the\nregular behaviour of recurrent epidemics, and the former the superimposed noise\nof observed incidence patterns. Recently, a stochastic theory based on a\nmechanism of resonance with internal noise has shifted the role of\nstochasticity closer to the center stage, by showing that the major dynamic\npatterns found in the incidence data can be explained as resonant fluctuations,\nwhose behaviour is largely independent of the amplitude of seasonal forcing,\nand by contrast very sensitive to the basic epidemiological parameters. Here we\nelaborate on that approach, by adding an ingredient which is missing in\nstandard epidemic models, the 'mixing network' through which infection may\npropagate. We find that spatial correlations have a major effect in the\nenhancement of the amplitude and the coherence of the resonant stochastic\nfluctuations, providing the ordered patterns of recurrent epidemics, whose\nperiod may differ significantly from that of the small oscillations around the\ndeterministic equilibrium. We also show that the inclusion of a more realistic,\ntime correlated, recovery profile instead of exponentially distributed\ninfectious periods may, even in the random-mixing limit, contribute to the same\neffect.\n",

        "abstract": "  The determination of a patient's DNA sequence can, in principle, reveal an\nincreased risk to fall ill with particular diseases [1,2] and help to design\n\"personalized medicine\" [3]. Moreover, statistical studies and comparison of\ngenomes [4] of a large number of individuals are crucial for the analysis of\nmutations [5] and hereditary diseases, paving the way to preventive medicine\n[6]. DNA sequencing is, however, currently still a vastly time-consuming and\nvery expensive task [4], consisting of pre-processing steps, the actual\nsequencing using the Sanger method, and post-processing in the form of data\nanalysis [7]. Here we propose a new approach that relies on functionalized\nnanopore-embedded electrodes to achieve an unambiguous distinction of the four\nnucleic acid bases in the DNA sequencing process. This represents a significant\nimprovement over previously studied designs [8,9] which cannot reliably\ndistinguish all four bases of DNA. The transport properties of the setup\ninvestigated by us, employing state-of-the-art density functional theory\ntogether with the non-equilibrium Green's Function method, leads to current\nresponses that differ by at least one order of magnitude for different bases\nand can thus provide a much more robust read-out of the base sequence. The\nimplementation of our proposed setup could thus lead to a viable protocol for\nrapid DNA sequencing with significant consequences for the future of genome\nrelated research in particular and health care in general.\n",

        "abstract": "  Biodiversity is essential to the viability of ecological systems. Species\ndiversity in ecosystems is promoted by cyclic, non-hierarchical interactions\namong competing populations. Such non-transitive relations lead to an evolution\nwith central features represented by the `rock-paper-scissors' game, where rock\ncrushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper wraps rock. In combination with\nspatial dispersal of static populations, this type of competition results in\nthe stable coexistence of all species and the long-term maintenance of\nbiodiversity. However, population mobility is a central feature of real\necosystems: animals migrate, bacteria run and tumble. Here, we observe a\ncritical influence of mobility on species diversity. When mobility exceeds a\ncertain value, biodiversity is jeopardized and lost. In contrast, below this\ncritical threshold all subpopulations coexist and an entanglement of travelling\nspiral waves forms in the course of temporal evolution. We establish that this\nphenomenon is robust, it does not depend on the details of cyclic competition\nor spatial environment. These findings have important implications for\nmaintenance and evolution of ecological systems and are relevant for the\nformation and propagation of patterns in excitable media, such as chemical\nkinetics or epidemic outbreaks.\n",

Males can be philanderer or faithful, while females are\neither fast or coy, leading to a cyclic dynamics. The adjusted replicator\nequation predicts stable coexistence of all four strategies. In this situation,\nwe consider the effects of fluctuations stemming from a finite population size.\nWe show that they unavoidably lead to extinction of two strategies in the\npopulation. However, the typical time until extinction occurs strongly prolongs\nwith increasing system size. In the meantime, a quasi-stationary probability\ndistribution forms that is anomalously flat in the vicinity of the coexistence\nstate. This behavior originates in a vanishing linear deterministic drift near\nthe fixed point. We provide numerical data as well as an analytical approach to\nthe mean extinction time and the quasi-stationary probability distribution.\n",

Very little has been rigorously established concerning\nthe identifiability of the models currently in common use in data analysis,\nalthough non-identifiability was proven for a semi-parametric model and an\nincorrect proof of identifiability was published for a general parametric model\n(GTR+Gamma+I). Here we prove that one of the most widely used models\n(GTR+Gamma) is identifiable for generic parameters, and for all parameter\nchoices in the case of 4-state (DNA) models.

Chem. Phys. 125, 144107 (2006)], a\nrecently-introduced multiscale leaping approach. We use the PLA to investigate\nstochastic effects in two model biochemical reaction networks. The networks\nthat we consider are simple enough so as to be accessible to our intuition but\nsufficiently complex so as to be generally representative of real biological\nsystems. We demonstrate how the PLA allows us to quantify subtle effects of\nstochasticity in these systems that would be difficult to ascertain otherwise\nas well as not-so-subtle behaviors that would strain commonly-used \"exact\"\nstochastic methods. We also illustrate bottlenecks that can hinder the approach\nand exemplify and discuss possible strategies for overcoming them. Overall, our\naim is to aid and motivate future applications of leaping by providing stark\nillustrations of the benefits of the method while at the same time elucidating\nobstacles that are often encountered in practice.\n",

For such an analysis, it is important to\nunearth interesting regularities in the spiking patterns. In this report, we\npresent an efficient method for automatically discovering synchrony, synfire\nchains, and more general sequences of neuronal firings. We use the Frequent\nEpisode Discovery framework of Laxman, Sastry, and Unnikrishnan (2005), in\nwhich the episodes are represented and recognized using finite-state automata.\nMany aspects of functional connectivity between neuronal populations can be\ninferred from the episodes. We demonstrate these using simulated multi-neuronal\ndata from a Poisson model. We also present a method to assess the statistical\nsignificance of the discovered episodes. Since the Temporal Data Mining (TDM)\nmethods used in this report can analyze data from hundreds and potentially\nthousands of neurons, we argue that this framework is appropriate for\ndiscovering the `Neural Code'.\n",

        "abstract": "  Regions in the genome that affect complex traits, quantitative trait loci\n(QTL), can be identified using statistical analysis of genetic and phenotypic\ndata. When restricted maximum-likelihood (REML) models are used, the mapping\nprocedure is normally computationally demanding. We develop a new efficient\ncomputational scheme for QTL mapping using variance component analysis and the\nAI-REML algorithm. The algorithm uses an exact or approximative low-rank\nrepresentation of the identity-by-descent matrix, which combined with the\nWoodbury formula for matrix inversion results in that the computations in the\nAI-REML iteration body can be performed more efficiently. For cases where an\nexact low-rank representation of the IBD matrix is available a-priori, the\nimproved AI-REML algorithm normally runs almost twice as fast compared to the\nstandard version. When an exact low-rank representation is not available, a\ntruncated spectral decomposition is used to determine a low-rank approximation.\nWe show that also in this case, the computational efficiency of the AI-REML\nscheme can often be significantly improved.\n",

Along these lines, we developed an\noriginal biofeedback system [1] whose underlying principle consists in\nsupplying the user with supplementary sensory information related to foot sole\npressure distribution through a tongue-placed output device (Tongue Display\nUnit, \"TDU\" [2]).

However, how the modular topology of the\nmolecular network affects the evolution of its member proteins remains unclear.\nIn this work, the functional and evolutionary modularity of Homo sapiens (H.\nsapiens) metabolic network were investigated from a topological point of view.\nNetwork decomposition shows that the metabolic network is organized in a highly\nmodular core-periphery way, in which the core modules are tightly linked\ntogether and perform basic metabolism functions, whereas the periphery modules\nonly interact with few modules and accomplish relatively independent and\nspecialized functions. Moreover, over half of the modules exhibit\nco-evolutionary feature and belong to specific evolutionary ages. Peripheral\nmodules tend to evolve more cohesively and faster than core modules do. The\ncorrelation between functional, evolutionary and topological modularity\nsuggests that the evolutionary history and functional requirements of metabolic\nsystems have been imprinted in the architecture of metabolic networks. Such\nsystems level analysis could demonstrate how the evolution of genes may be\nplaced in a genome-scale network context, giving a novel perspective on\nmolecular evolution.\n",

The authors find no dynamic difference between the reaction sets\nrecreated from the metabolic networks and randomized counterparts. We reproduce\nthe author's observation and find that their algorithm leads to a dynamical\nfragmentation and thus eliminates the topological information contained in the\ngraphs. Hence, their approach cannot rule out a connection between the topology\nof metabolic networks and the ubiquity of steady states.\n",

Using a simple model, we show that the\nbinding time can be minimized, under selective pressure, by adjusting the\nspectrum of conformational states so that the fraction of time spent in more\nmobile conformations is matched with the target recognition rate. The\nassociated optimal binding time is then within an order of magnitude of the\nlimiting binding time imposed by thermodynamics, corresponding to an idealized\nprotein with instant target recognition. Numerical estimates suggest that\ntypical bacteria operate in this regime of optimized conformational\nfluctuations.\n",

We explicitly show how to obtain such rate\nequation exactly for various binding mechanisms. Hence the proposed rate\nequation is formally rigorous. Various features of such a generic rate equation\nare discussed. For irreversible reactions, the product inhibition which\ndirectly arise from enzymatic reaction is eliminated in a natural way.

Some\nfeatures of the model, such as existence and uniqueness of solutions and\nconvergence to the dynamical system of an approximating sequence of discrete\ntime models, were presented in earlier work by Evans, Steinsaltz, and Wachter\nfor quite general selective costs. Here we study a special case where the\nselective cost of a genotype with a given accumulation of ancestral mutations\nfrom a wild type ancestor is a sum of costs attributable to each individual\nmutation plus successive interaction contributions from each $k$-tuple of\nmutations for $k$ up to some finite ``degree''. Using ideas from complex\nchemical reaction networks and a novel Lyapunov function, we establish that the\nphenomenon of mutation-selection balance occurs for such selection costs under\nmild conditions. That is, we show that the dynamical system has a unique\nequilibrium and that it converges to this equilibrium from all initial\nconditions.\n",

The typical size of these motors and the forces\nthey generate are of the order of nano-meters and pico-Newtons, respectively.\nThey are subjected to random bombardments by the molecules of the surrounding\naqueous medium and, therefore, follow noisy trajectories. Because of their\nsmall inertia, their movements in the viscous intracellular space exhibits\nfeatures that are characteristics of hydrodynamics at low Reynold's number.

        "abstract": "  Over the brief time intervals available for processing retinal output,\nroughly 50 to 300 msec, the number of extra spikes generated by individual\nganglion cells can be quite variable. Here, computer-generated spike trains\nwere used to investigate how signal/noise might be improved by utilizing\nspatiotemporal correlations among retinal neurons responding to large,\ncontiguous stimuli. Realistic correlations were produced by modulating the\ninstantaneous firing probabilities of all stimulated neurons by a common\noscillatory input whose amplitude and temporal structure were consistent with\nexperimentally measured field potentials and correlograms. Whereas previous\nstudies have typically measured synergy between pairs of ganglion cells\nexamined one at a time, or alternatively have employed optimized linear filters\nto decode activity across larger populations, the present study investigated a\ndistributed, non-linear encoding strategy by using Principal Components\nAnalysis (PCA) to reconstruct simple visual stimuli from up to one million\noscillatory pairwise correlations extracted on single trials from\nmassively-parallel spike trains as short as 25 msec in duration. By integrating\nsignals across retinal neighborhoods commensurate in size to classical\nantagonistic surrounds, the first principal component of the pairwise\ncorrelation matrix yielded dramatic improvements in signal/noise without\nsacrificing fine spatial detail. These results demonstrate how local intensity\ninformation can distributed across hundreds of neurons linked by a common,\nstimulus-dependent oscillatory modulation, a strategy that might have evolved\nto minimize the number of spikes required to support rapid image\nreconstruction.\n",

To this aim, sixteen young healthy adults\nwere asked to stand as immobile as possible with their eyes closed in two\nconditions of No-biofeedback and Biofeedback. Centre of foot pressure (CoP)\ndisplacements, recorded using a force platform, were used to compute the\nhorizontal displacements of the vertical projection the centre of gravity\n(CoGh) and those of the difference between the CoP and the vertical projection\nof the CoG (CoP-CoGv). Altogether, the present findings suggest that the main\nway the plantar pressure-based, tongue-placed tactile biofeedback improves\npostural control during quiet standing is via both a reduction of the\ncorrection thresholds and an increased efficiency of the corrective mechanism\ninvolving the CoGh displacements.\n",

        "abstract": "  The goal of this paper is to outline a scenario of emerging stochasticity in\nhigh-dimensional highly nonlinear systems, such as genetic regulatory networks\n(GRN). We focus attention on the fact that in such systems confluence of all\nthe factors necessary for gene expression is a comparatively rare event, and\nonly massive redundancy makes such events sufficiently frequent. An immediate\nconsequence of this rareness is burstiness in mRNA and protein copy numbers, a\nwell known experimentally observed effect. We introduce the concept of\nstochastic cooperativity and show that this phenomenon is a natural consequence\nof high dimensionality coupled with highly nonlinearity of a dynamical system.\nIn mathematical terms, burstiness is associated with heavy-tailed probability\ndistributions of stochastic processes describing the dynamics of the system.\nThe sequence of stochastic cooperativity events allows for transition from\ncontinuous deterministic dynamics expressed in terms of ordinary differential\nequations (ODE) to discrete stochastic dynamics expressed in terms of Langevin\nand Fokker-Plank equations. We demonstrate also that high-dimensional nonlinear\nsystems, even in the absence of explicit mechanisms for suppressing inherent\ninstability, may nevertheless reside in a state of stationary pseudo-random\nfluctuations which for all practical purposes may be regarded as stochastic\nprocess. This type of stochastic behavior is an inherent property of such\nsystems and requires neither an external random force, nor highly specialized\nconditions of bistability.\n",

        "abstract": "  We propose a novel method to embed a functional magnetic resonance imaging\n(fMRI) dataset in a low-dimensional space. The embedding optimally preserves\nthe local functional coupling between fMRI time series and provides a\nlow-dimensional coordinate system for detecting activated voxels. To compute\nthe embedding, we build a graph of functionally connected voxels. We use the\ncommute time, instead of the geodesic distance, to measure functional distances\non the graph. Because the commute time can be computed directly from the\neigenvectors of (a symmetric version) the graph probability transition matrix,\nwe use these eigenvectors to embed the dataset in low dimensions. After\nclustering the datasets in low dimensions, coherent structures emerge that can\nbe easily interpreted. We performed an extensive evaluation of our method\ncomparing it to linear and nonlinear techniques using synthetic datasets and in\nvivo datasets. We analyzed datasets from the EBC competition obtained with\nsubjects interacting in an urban virtual reality environment. Our exploratory\napproach is able to detect independently visual areas (V1/V2, V5/MT), auditory\nareas, and language areas. Our method can be used to analyze fMRI collected\nduring ``natural stimuli''.\n",

        "abstract": "  In unicellular organisms such as bacteria the same acquired mutations\nbeneficial in one environment can be restrictive in another. However, evolving\nEscherichia coli populations demonstrate remarkable flexibility in adaptation.\nThe mechanisms sustaining genetic flexibility remain unclear. In E. coli the\ntranscriptional regulation of gene expression involves both dedicated\nregulators binding specific DNA sites with high affinity and also global\nregulators - abundant DNA architectural proteins of the bacterial chromoid\nbinding multiple low affinity sites and thus modulating the superhelical\ndensity of DNA. The first form of transcriptional regulation is dominantly\npairwise and specific, representing digitial control, while the second form is\n(in strength and distribution) continuous, representing analog control. Here we\nlook at the properties of effective networks derived from significant gene\nexpression changes under variation of the two forms of control and find that\nupon limitations of one type of control (caused e.g. by mutation of a global\nDNA architectural factor) the other type can compensate for compromised\nregulation. Mutations of global regulators significantly enhance the digital\ncontrol; in the presence of global DNA architectural proteins regulation is\nmostly of the analog type, coupling spatially neighboring genomic loci;\ntogether our data suggest that two logically distinct types of control are\nbalancing each other. By revealing two distinct logical types of control, our\napproach provides basic insights into both the organizational principles of\ntranscriptional regulation and the mechanisms buffering genetic flexibility. We\nanticipate that the general concept of distinguishing logical types of control\nwill apply to many complex biological networks.\n",

        "abstract": "  Small single-domain proteins often exhibit only a single free-energy barrier,\nor transition state, between the denatured and the native state. The folding\nkinetics of these proteins is usually explored via mutational analysis. A\ncentral question is which structural information on the transition state can be\nderived from the mutational data. In this article, we model and structurally\ninterpret mutational Phi-values for two small beta-sheet proteins, the PIN and\nthe FBP WW domain. The native structure of these WW domains comprises two\nbeta-hairpins that form a three-stranded beta-sheet. In our model, we assume\nthat the transition state consists of two conformations in which either one of\nthe hairpins is formed. Such a transition state has been recently observed in\nMolecular Dynamics folding-unfolding simulations of a small designed\nthree-stranded beta-sheet protein. We obtain good agreement with the\nexperimental data (i) by splitting up the mutation-induced free-energy changes\ninto terms for the two hairpins and for the small hydrophobic core of the\nproteins, and (ii) by fitting a single parameter, the relative degree to which\nhairpin 1 and 2 are formed in the transition state. The model helps to\nunderstand how mutations affect the folding kinetics of WW domains, and\ncaptures also negative Phi-values that have been difficult to interpret.\n",

        "abstract": "  In many intracellular processes, the length distribution of microtubules is\ncontrolled by depolymerizing motor proteins. Experiments have shown that,\nfollowing non-specific binding to the surface of a microtubule, depolymerizers\nare transported to the microtubule tip(s) by diffusion or directed walk and,\nthen, depolymerize the microtubule from the tip(s) after accumulating there. We\ndevelop a quantitative model to study the depolymerizing action of such a\ngeneric motor protein, and its possible effects on the length distribution of\nmicrotubules. We show that, when the motor protein concentration in solution\nexceeds a critical value, a steady state is reached where the length\ndistribution is, in general, non-monotonic with a single peak. However, for\nhighly processive motors and large motor densities, this distribution\neffectively becomes an exponential decay. Our findings suggest that such motor\nproteins may be selectively used by the cell to ensure precise control of MT\nlengths. The model is also used to analyze experimental observations of\nmotor-induced depolymerization.\n",

These proteins in\nturn modulate the expression levels of the genes under their control and\nsometimes need to perform non-trivial computations that integrate several\ninputs and affect multiple genes. At the same time, the activities of the\nregulated genes would fluctuate even if the inputs were held fixed, as a\nconsequence of the intrinsic noise in the system, and such noise must\nfundamentally limit the reliability of any genetic computation. Here we use\ninformation theory to formalize the notion of information transmission in\nsimple genetic regulatory elements in the presence of physically realistic\nnoise sources. The dependence of this \"channel capacity\" on noise parameters,\ncooperativity and cost of making signaling molecules is explored\nsystematically. We find that, at least in principle, capacities higher than one\nbit should be achievable and that consequently genetic regulation is not\nlimited the use of binary, or \"on-off\", components.\n",

Here we present\nthe first analysis of the emergence of syntax in terms of complex networks. A\npreviously unreported, sharp transition is shown to occur around two years of\nage from a (pre-syntactic) tree-like structure to a scale-free, small world\nsyntax network. The nature of such transition supports the presence of an\ninnate component pervading the emergence of full syntax. This observation is\ndifficult to interpret in terms of any simple model of network growth, thus\nsuggesting that some internal, perhaps innate component was at work. We explore\nthis problem by using a minimal model that is able to capture several\nstatistical traits. Our results provide evidence for adaptive traits, but it\nalso indicates that some key features of syntax might actually correspond to\nnon-adaptive phenomena.\n",

        "abstract": "  We present a mathematical analysis of a networks with Integrate-and-Fire\nneurons and adaptive conductances. Taking into account the realistic fact that\nthe spike time is only known within some \\textit{finite} precision, we propose\na model where spikes are effective at times multiple of a characteristic time\nscale $\\delta$, where $\\delta$ can be \\textit{arbitrary} small (in particular,\nwell beyond the numerical precision). We make a complete mathematical\ncharacterization of the model-dynamics and obtain the following results. The\nasymptotic dynamics is composed by finitely many stable periodic orbits, whose\nnumber and period can be arbitrary large and can diverge in a region of the\nsynaptic weights space, traditionally called the \"edge of chaos\", a notion\nmathematically well defined in the present paper. Furthermore, except at the\nedge of chaos, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the membrane\npotential trajectories and the raster plot. This shows that the neural code is\nentirely \"in the spikes\" in this case. As a key tool, we introduce an order\nparameter, easy to compute numerically, and closely related to a natural notion\nof entropy, providing a relevant characterization of the computational\ncapabilities of the network. This allows us to compare the computational\ncapabilities of leaky and Integrate-and-Fire models and conductance based\nmodels. The present study considers networks with constant input, and without\ntime-dependent plasticity, but the framework has been designed for both\nextensions.\n",

        "abstract": "  On the basis of the general character and operation of the process of\nperception, a formalism is sought to mathematically describe the subjective or\nabstract/mental process of perception. It is shown that the formalism of\northodox quantum theory of measurement, where the observer plays a key role, is\na broader mathematical foundation which can be adopted to describe the dynamics\nof the subjective experience. The mathematical formalism describes the\npsychophysical dynamics of the subjective or cognitive experience as\ncommunicated to us by the subject. Subsequently, the formalism is used to\ndescribe simple perception processes and, in particular, to describe the\nprobability distribution of dominance duration obtained from the testimony of\nsubjects experiencing binocular rivalry. Using this theory and parameters based\non known values of neuronal oscillation frequencies and firing rates, the\ncalculated probability distribution of dominance duration of rival states in\nbinocular rivalry under various conditions is found to be in good agreement\nwith available experimental data. This theory naturally explains an observed\nmarked increase in dominance duration in binocular rivalry upon periodic\ninterruption of stimulus and yields testable predictions for the distribution\nof perceptual alteration in time.\n",

        "abstract": "  Whereas the acuity of the position sense at the ankle can be disturbed by\nmuscle fatigue, it recently also has been shown to be improved, under normal\nankle neuromuscular state, through the use of an artificial tongue-placed\ntactile biofeedback. The underlying principle of this biofeedback consisted of\nsupplying individuals with supplementary information about the position of\ntheir matching ankle position relative to their reference ankle position\nthrough electrotactile stimulation of the tongue. Within this context, the\npurpose of the present experiment was to investigate whether this biofeedback\ncould mitigate the deleterious effect of muscle fatigue on joint position sense\nat the ankle. To address this objective, sixteen young healthy university\nstudents were asked to perform an active ankle-matching task in two conditions\nof No-fatigue and Fatigue of the ankle muscles and two conditions of\nNo-biofeedback and Biofeedback. Measures of the overall accuracy and the\nvariability of the positioning were determined using the absolute error and the\nvariable error, respectively. Results showed that the availability of the\nbiofeedback allowed the subjects to suppress the deleterious effects of muscle\nfatigue on joint position sense at the ankle. In the context of sensory\nre-weighting process, these findings suggested that the central nervous system\nwas able to integrate and increase the relative contribution of the artificial\ntongue-placed tactile biofeedback to compensate for a proprioceptive\ndegradation at the ankle.\n",

In this\nwork, we theoretically investigate the feasibility of inferring single RNA's\nintrinsic kinetic parameters from the time series obtained by forced\nfolding/unfolding experiment done in the light tweezer, where the molecule is\nflanked by long double-stranded DNA/RNA handles and tethered between two big\nbeads. We first construct a coarse-grain physical model of the experimental\nsystem. The model has captured the major physical factors: the Brownian motion\nof the bead, the molecular structural transition, and the elasticity of the\nhandles and RNA. Then based on an analytic solution of the model, a Bayesian\nmethod using Monte Carlo Markov Chain is proposed to infer the intrinsic\nkinetic parameters of the RNA from the noisy time series of the distance or\nforce. Because the force fluctuation induced by the Brownian motion of the bead\nand the structural transition can significantly modulate the transition rates\nof the RNA, we prove that, this statistic method is more accurate and efficient\nthan the conventional histogram fitting method in inferring the molecule's\nintrinsic parameters.\n",

We report the calculations of\nstability domains of actin genes for various organisms in the animal, plant and\nfungi kingdoms. Actin genes have been chosen because they have been highly\nconserved during evolution. In these genes all introns were removed so as to\nmimic ancient genes at the time of the early eukaryotic development, i.e.\nbefore introns insertion. Common stability boundaries are found in evolutionary\ndistant organisms, which implies that these boundaries date from the early\norigin of eukaryotes. In general boundaries correspond with introns positions\nof vertebrates and other animals actins, but not much for plants and fungi. The\nsharpest boundary is found in a locus where fungi, algae and animals have\nintrons in positions separated by one nucleotide only, which identifies a\nhot-spot for insertion. These results suggest that some introns may have been\nincorporated into the genomes through a thermodynamic driven mechanism, in\nagreement with previous observations on human genes. They also suggest a\ndifferent mechanism for introns insertion in plants and animals.\n",

This sense of recognition is known as familiarity. Following\nprevious computational models of familiarity memory we investigate the\ndynamical properties of familiarity discrimination, and contrast two different\nfamiliarity discriminators: one based on the energy of the neural network, and\nthe other based on the time derivative of the energy. We show how the\nfamiliarity signal decays after a stimulus is presented, and examine the\nrobustness of the familiarity discriminator in the presence of random\nfluctuations in neural activity. For both discriminators we establish, via a\ncombined method of signal-to-noise ratio and mean field analysis, how the\nmaximum number of successfully discriminated stimuli depends on the noise\nlevel.\n",

        "abstract": "  The genetic repressilator circuit consists of three transcription factors, or\nrepressors, which negatively regulate each other in a cyclic manner. This\ncircuit was synthetically constructed on plasmids in {\\it Escherichia coli} and\nwas found to exhibit oscillations in the concentrations of the three\nrepressors. Since the repressors and their binding sites often appear in low\ncopy numbers, the oscillations are noisy and irregular. Therefore, the\nrepressilator circuit cannot be fully analyzed using deterministic methods such\nas rate-equations. Here we perform stochastic analysis of the repressilator\ncircuit using the master equation and Monte Carlo simulations. It is found that\nfluctuations modify the range of conditions in which oscillations appear as\nwell as their amplitude and period, compared to the deterministic equations.\nThe deterministic and stochastic approaches coincide only in the limit in which\nall the relevant components, including free proteins, plasmids and bound\nproteins, appear in high copy numbers. We also find that subtle features such\nas cooperative binding and bound-repressor degradation strongly affect the\nexistence and properties of the oscillations.\n",

        "abstract": "  Cellular networks undergo rearrangements during stress and diseases. In\nun-stressed state the yeast protein-protein interaction network (interactome)\nis highly compact, and the centrally organized modules have a large overlap.\nDuring stress several original modules became more separated, and a number of\nnovel modules also appear. A few basic functions, such as the proteasome\npreserve their central position. However, several functions with high energy\ndemand, such the cell-cycle regulation loose their original centrality during\nstress. A number of key stress-dependent protein complexes, such as the\ndisaggregation-specific chaperone, Hsp104, gain centrality in the stressed\nyeast interactome. Molecular chaperones, heat shock, or stress proteins form\ncomplex interaction networks (the chaperome) with each other and their\npartners. Here we show that the human chaperome recovers the segregation of\nprotein synthesis-coupled and stress-related chaperones observed in yeast\nrecently. Examination of yeast and human interactomes shows that (1) chaperones\nare inter-modular integrators of protein-protein interaction networks, which\n(2) often bridge hubs and (3) are favorite candidates for extensive\nphosphorylation. Moreover, chaperones (4) become more central in the\norganization of the isolated modules of the stressed yeast protein-protein\ninteraction network, which highlights their importance in the de-coupling and\nre-coupling of network modules during and after stress. Chaperone-mediated\nevolvability of cellular networks may play a key role in cellular adaptation\nduring stress and various polygenic and chronic diseases, such as cancer,\ndiabetes or neurodegeneration.\n",

Subdiffusive motion was characterised by a\nrheological scaling exponent of 3/4 in the cortex, indicative of the\nsemiflexible dynamics of the actin fibres. We observed shear-thinning in the\nflowing endoplasm, where exponents increased with increasing flow rate; i.e.\nthe endoplasm became more fluid-like. The rheology of the cortex is found to be\nisotropic, reflecting an isotropic actin gel. A clear difference was seen\nbetween cortical and endoplasmic layers in terms of both viscoelasticity and\nflow velocity, where the profile of the latter is close to a Poiseuille flow\nfor a Newtonian fluid.\n",

An important first step in the process was the application of data\ncleaning and disambiguation methods to construct a unified database, since the\ndata were too noisy to be of full utility in the raw form initially available.\nThe resulting co-author graph in 2006, for example, had 39,645 nodes (with an\nestimated 6% error rate in our disambiguation of similar author names) and\n13,979 abstracts, with an average of 1.5 abstracts per author, 4.3 authors per\nabstract, and 5.96 collaborators per author (including all authors on shared\nabstracts). Recent work in related areas has focused on reputational indices\nsuch as highly cited papers or scientists and journal impact factors, and to a\nlesser extent on creating visual maps of the knowledge space. In contrast,\nthere has been relatively less work on the demographics and community\nstructure, the dynamics of the field over time to examine major research trends\nand the structure of the sources of research funding. In this paper we examined\neach of these areas in order to gain an objective overview of contemporary\nneuroscience. Some interesting findings include a high geographical\nconcentration of neuroscience research in north eastern United States, a\nsurprisingly large transient population (60% of the authors appear in only one\nout of the six studied years), the central role played by the study of\nneurodegenerative disorders in the neuroscience community structure, and an\napparent growth of behavioral/systems neuroscience with a corresponding\nshrinkage of cellular/molecular neuroscience over the six year period.\n",

        "abstract": "  This paper deals with the EEG/MEG neuroimaging problem: given measurements of\nscalp electric potential differences (EEG: electroencephalogram) and\nextracranial magnetic fields (MEG: magnetoencephalogram), find the 3D\ndistribution of the generating electric neuronal activity. This problem has no\nunique solution. Only particular solutions with \"good\" localization properties\nare of interest, since neuroimaging is concerned with the localization of brain\nfunction. In this paper, a general family of linear imaging methods with exact,\nzero error localization to point-test sources is presented. One particular\nmember of this family is sLORETA (standardized low resolution brain\nelectromagnetic tomography; Pascual-Marqui, Methods Find. Exp. Clin. Pharmacol.\n2002, 24D:5-12;\nhttp://www.unizh.ch/keyinst/NewLORETA/sLORETA/sLORETA-Math01.pdf). It is shown\nhere that sLORETA has no localization bias in the presence of measurement and\nbiological noise. Another member of this family, denoted as eLORETA (exact low\nresolution brain electromagnetic tomography; Pascual-Marqui 2005:\nhttp://www.research-projects.unizh.ch/p6990.htm), is a genuine inverse solution\n(not merely a linear imaging method) with exact, zero error localization in the\npresence of measurement and structured biological noise. The general family of\nimaging methods is further extended to include data-dependent (adaptive)\nquasi-linear imaging methods, also with the exact, zero error localization\nproperty.\n",

However, their current construction as monolithic sets\nof equations presents a fundamental barrier to progress. Overcoming this\nrequires modularity, enabling sub-systems to be specified independently and\ncombined incrementally, and abstraction, enabling general properties to be\nspecified independently of specific instances. These in turn require models to\nbe represented as programs rather than as datatypes. Programmable modularity\nand abstraction enables libraries of modules to be created for generic\nbiological processes, which can be instantiated and re-used repeatedly in\ndifferent contexts with different components. We have developed a computational\ninfrastructure to support this. We show here why these capabilities are needed,\nwhat is required to implement them and what can be accomplished with them that\ncould not be done previously.\n",

        "abstract": "  Many illnesses are associated with an alteration of the immune system\nhomeostasis due to any combination of factors, including exogenous bacterial\ninsult, endogenous breakdown (e.g., development of a disease that results in\nimmuno suppression), or an exogenous hit like surgery that simultaneously\nalters immune responsiveness and provides access to bacteria, or genetic\ndisorder. We conjecture that, as a consequence of the co-evolution of the\nimmune system of individuals with the ecology of pathogens, the homeostasis of\nthe immune system requires the influx of pathogens. This allows the immune\nsystem to keep the ever present pathogens under control and to react and adjust\nfast to bursts of infections. We construct the simplest and most general system\nof rate equations which describes the dynamics of five compartments: healthy\ncells, altered cells, adaptive and innate immune cells, and pathogens. We study\nfour regimes obtained with or without auto-immune disorder and with or without\nspontaneous proliferation of infected cells. Over all regimes, we find that\nseven different states are naturally described by the model: (i) strong healthy\nimmune system, (ii) healthy organism with evanescent immune cells, (iii)\nchronic infections, (iv) strong infections, (v) cancer, (vi) critically ill\nstate and (vii) death. The analysis of stability conditions demonstrates that\nthese seven states depend on the balance between the robustness of the immune\nsystem and the influx of pathogens.\n",

Epigenetic silencing of genes via heritable\nchromatin modifications plays a major role in cell fate specification in higher\norganisms. We formulate a coarse-grained model of chromatin silencing in yeast\nand study the conditions under which the system becomes bistable, allowing for\ndifferent epigenetic states. We also study the dynamics of the boundary between\nthe two locally stable states of chromatin: silenced and unsilenced. The model\ncould be of use in guiding the discussion on chromatin silencing in general. In\nthe context of silencing in budding yeast, it helps us understand the phenotype\nof various mutants, some of which may be non-trivial to see without the help of\na mathematical model. One such example is a mutation that reduces the rate of\nbackground acetylation of particular histone side-chains that competes with the\ndeacetylation by Sir2p. The resulting negative feedback due to a Sir protein\ndepletion effect gives rise to interesting counter-intuitive consequences. Our\nmathematical analysis brings forth the different dynamical behaviors possible\nwithin the same molecular model and guides the formulation of more refined\nhypotheses that could be addressed experimentally.\n",

We show\nhow the entropy estimates can be used to test for the existence of long-term\nstructure in the data, and we construct a hypothesis test for whether the\nrenewal process model is appropriate for these spike trains.

However, Bayesian networks and many\nother current reconstruction methods rely on assumptions that conflict with the\ndifferential equations that describe transcriptional kinetics. Practical\napproximations of kinetic models would enable inferring causal relationships\nbetween genes from expression data of microarray, tag-based and conventional\nplatforms, but conclusions are sensitive to the assumptions made.\n  Results: The representation of a sufficiently large portion of genome enables\ncomputation of an upper bound on how much confidence one may place in\ninfluences between genes on the basis of expression data. Information about\nwhich genes encode transcription factors is not necessary but may be\nincorporated if available. The methodology is generalized to cover cases in\nwhich expression measurements are missing for many of the genes that might\ncontrol the transcription of the genes of interest. The assumption that the\ngene expression level is roughly proportional to the rate of translation led to\nbetter empirical performance than did either the assumption that the gene\nexpression level is roughly proportional to the protein level or the Bayesian\nmodel average of both assumptions.\n  Availability: http://www.oisb.ca points to R code implementing the methods (R\nDevelopment Core Team 2004).\n  Supplementary information: http://www.davidbickel.com\n",

To clarify this issue, important distinctions between information and\nsigns are introduced here and the concepts of information control and\nfunctional equivalence classes in those systems are rigorously defined and used\nto characterise when top down causation by feedback control happens, in a way\nthat is testable. The causally significant elements we consider are equivalence\nclasses of lower level processes, realised in biological systems through\ndifferent operations having the same outcome within the context of information\ncontrol and networks.\n",

Defining this robustness property is a\nchallenging task, but mathematical models have often associated it to the\nvolume of the space of admissible parameters. Not only the volume of the space\nbut also its topology and geometry contain information on essential aspects of\nthe network, including feasible pathways, switching between two parallel\npathways or distinct/disconnected active regions of parameters. A general\nmethod is presented here to characterize the space of admissible parameters, by\nwriting it as a semi-algebraic set, and then theoretically analyzing its\ntopology and geometry, as well as volume. This method provides a more objective\nand complete measure of the robustness of a developmental module. As an\nillustration, the segment polarity gene network is analyzed.\n",

The duration of each move is stochastic and depends upon\nthe chemoattractant concentration experienced in the recent past. We relate\nthis stochastic behavior to the steady-state density of a bacterium population,\nand we derive the latter as a function of chemoattractant concentration. In\ncontrast to earlier treatments, here we account for the effects of temporal\ncorrelations and variable tumbling durations. A range of behaviors obtains,\nthat depends subtly upon several aspects of the system - memory, correlation,\nand tumbling stochasticity in particular.\n",

Within this system, the putative tumor suppressor insulin-degrading\nenzyme (IDE) should be an important modulator. Perhaps most remarkably, the\nabstraction of this encounter between insulin and RB, two growth-regulatory\ngiants acting either in concert or against each other depending on the\nrespective cellular requirements, reveals that Nature may compute in\ncontrolling cell fate and we could follow in its footsteps towards developing\nmore efficient therapeutics as well as novel technical devices.\n",

Despite this insight, even recently founded disciplines such as\nsystems biology are still locked in this century-old mind-set of cellular\nbuilding blocks and thus predictably of limited usefulness. Other studies\nconducted over the past years, however, suggest that there is something more\nfundamental to life and its various conditions than the cell: peptide strings.\nHere, I review the origin and nature of these sub- and trans-cellular elements\nas well as their potential to provide the long-sought answers hitherto\ninaccessible to cell biology.\n",

        "abstract": "  Evolution of the spatial arrangement of cells in a primary culture of cardiac\ntissue derived from newborn rats was studied experimentally over extended\nperiod. It was found that cells attract each other spontaneously to form a\nclustered structure over the timescale of several days. These clusters exhibit\nspontaneous rhythmic contraction and have been confirmed to consist of cardiac\nmuscle cells. Addition of a contraction inhibitor (2,3-butanedione-2-monoxime)\nto the culture medium resulted in the inhibition of both the spontaneous\ncontractions exhibited by the cells as well as the formation of clusters.\nFurthermore, the formation of clusters is suppressed when high concentrations\nof collagen are used for coating the substratum to which the cells adhere. From\nthese experimental observations, it was deduced that the cells are mechanically\nstressed by the tension associated with repeated contractions and that this\nresults in the cells becoming compact and attracting each other, finally\nresulting in the formation of clusters. This process can be interpreted as\nmodulation of a cellular network by the activity associated with contraction,\nwhich could be employed to control cellular networks by modifying the dynamics\nassociated with the contractions in cardiac tissue culture.\n",

Recent work can be roughly\nclassified into either dynamical models of well-described subsystems, or\ncoarse-grained descriptions of the topology of the molecular networks at the\nscale of the whole organism. In order to bridge these two disparate approaches\none needs to develop simplified descriptions of dynamics and topological\nmeasures which address the propagation of signals in molecular networks. Here,\nwe consider the directed network of protein regulation in E. coli,\ncharacterizing its modularity in terms of its potential to transmit signals. We\ndemonstrate that the simplest measure based on identifying sub-networks of\nstrong components, within which each node could send a signal to every other\nnode, indeed partitions the network into functional modules. We then suggest\nmeasures to quantify the cost and spread associated with sending a signal\nbetween any particular pair of proteins. Thereby, we address the signalling\nspecificity within and between modules, and show that in the regulation of\nE.coli there is a systematic reduction of the cost and spread for signals\ntraveling over more than two intermediate reactions.\n",

Motivated\nby several discovered signaling mechanisms which create colony-level responses,\nwe present a model for the influence of quorum-sensing signals on a colony of\nB. Subtilis cells during the transition to genetic competence. Coupling to the\nexternal signal creates an effective inhibitory mechanism, which results in\nanti-correlation between the cycles of adjacent cells. We show that this\nscenario is consistent with the specific experimental measurement, which fails\nto detect some underlying collective signaling mechanisms. Rather, we suggest\nother parameters that should be used to verify the role of a quorum-sensing\nsignal. We also study the conditions under which phenotypic spatial patterns\nmay emerge.\n",

Proteins are described in the framework of an effective\npotential model which contains the Ramachandran angles as degrees of freedom\nand does not need any {\\it a priori} information about the native state.\nHydrogen bonds, dipole-dipole- and hydrophobic interactions are taken\nexplicitly into account. An interesting feature displayed by this potential is\nthe presence of some intermediates between the unfolded and native states. We\nconsider different types of confining potentials in order to study the\nstructural properties of proteins folding inside cages with repulsive or\nattractive walls. Using the Wang-Landau algorithm we determine the density of\nstates (DOS) and analyze in detail the thermodynamical properties of the\nconfined proteins for different sizes of the cages. We show that confinement\ndramatically reduces the phase space available to the protein and that the\npresence of intermediate states can be controlled by varying the properties of\nthe confining potential. Cages with strongly attractive walls lead to the\ndisappearance of the intermediate states and to a two-state folding into a less\nstable configuration. However, cages with slightly attractive walls make the\nnative structure more stable than in the case of pure repulsive potentials, and\nthe folding process occurs through intermediate configurations. In order to\ntest the metastable states we analyze the free energy landscapes as a function\nof the configurational energy and of the end-to-end distance as an order\nparameter.\n",

The issue is how the time constants associated with episodes of\ntranscriptional bursting impact cellular mRNA and protein distributions and\nreciprocally, to what extent experimentally observed distributions can be\nattributed to transcriptional pulsing. We address these questions by\ninvestigating the exact time-dependent solution of the Master equation for a\ntranscriptional pulsing model of mRNA distributions. We find a plethora of\nresults: we show that, among others, bimodal and long-tailed (power law)\ndistributions occur in the steady state as the rate constants are varied over\nbiologically significant time scales. Since steady state distributions may not\nbe reached experimentally we present results for the time evolution of the\ndistributions. Because cellular behavior is essentially determined by proteins,\nwe investigate the effect of the different mRNA distributions on the\ncorresponding protein distributions. We delineate the regimes of rate constants\nfor which the protein distribution mimics the mRNA distribution and those for\nwhich the protein distribution deviates significantly from the mRNA\ndistribution.\n",

The linear\nconstraints, like mass conservation constraint, reversibility constraint,\nbiological capacity constraint, can be imposed on linear algorithms. However,\nrecently a non-linear constraint based on the second thermodynamic law, known\nas \"loop law\", has emerged and challenged the existing algorithms. Proven to be\nunfeasible with linear solutions, this non-linear constraint has been\nsuccessfully imposed on the sampling process. In this place, Monte - Carlo\nsampling with Metropolis criterion and Simulated Annealing has been introduced\nto optimize the Biomass synthesis of genome scale metabolic network of\nHelicobacter pylori (iIT341 GSM / GPR) under mass conservation constraint,\nbiological capacity constraint, and thermodynamic constraints including\nreversibility and \"loop law\". The sampling method has also been employed to\noptimize a non-linear objective function, the Biomass synthetic rate, which is\nunified by the total income number of reducible electrons. To verify whether a\nsample contains internal loops, an automatic solution has been developed based\non solving a set of inequalities. In addition, a new type of pathway has been\nproposed here, the Futile Pathway, which has three properties: 1) its mass flow\ncould be self-balanced; 2) it has exchange reactions; 3) it is independent to\nthe biomass synthesis. To eliminate the fluxes of the Futile Pathways in the\nsampling results, a linear programming based method has been suggested and the\nresults have showed improved correlations among the reaction fluxes in the\npathways related to Biomass synthesis.\n",

The phenomena occur under the perturbation of\nexcitatory synaptic interaction that has a high efficacy. We showed that the\ndecrease of synaptic current results in spike death through depressing the\nfeedback of sodium ionic current. In the networks with spike death property the\ndegree of synchronization is lower and unsensitive to the heterogeneity of\nneurons.

How do the dynamical properties and state-space structures of\nnetworks with high and low robustness differ? Does selection operate on the\nglobal dynamical behavior of the networks? What kind of state-space structures\nare favored by selection? We provide damage propagation analysis and an\nextensive statistical analysis of state spaces of these model networks to show\nthat the change in their dynamical properties due to stabilizing selection for\noptimal phenotypes is minor. Most notably, the networks that are most robust to\nboth mutations and noise are highly chaotic. Certain properties of chaotic\nnetworks, such as being able to produce large attractor basins, can be useful\nfor maintaining a stable gene-expression pattern. Our findings indicate that\nconventional measures of stability, such as the damage-propagation rate, do not\nprovide much information about robustness to mutations or noise in model gene\nregulatory networks.\n",

In many situations, especially in vivo, the traditional\nlimitation of such recordings is the high electrode resistance, which may cause\nsignificant measurement errors. We introduce a computer-aided technique, Active\nElectrode Compensation (AEC), based on a digital model of the electrode\ninterfaced in real time with the electrophysiological setup. The\ncharacteristics of this model are first estimated using white noise current\ninjection. The electrode and membrane contribution are digitally separated, and\nthe recording is then made by online subtraction of the electrode contribution.\nTests comparing AEC to other techniques demonstrate that it yields recordings\nwith improved accuracy. It enables high-frequency recordings in demanding\nconditions, such as injection of conductance noise in dynamic-clamp mode, not\nfeasible with a single high resistance electrode until now. AEC should be\nparticularly useful to characterize fast phenomena in neurons, in vivo and in\nvitro.\n",

This suggests that local topological\nfeatures of regulatory networks, including broad degree distributions, emerge\nas an implicit result of matching a number of needed processes to a finite\ntoolbox of proteins.\n",

Our computer simulations are based on a\nLangevin equation accounting for hydrodynamic interactions, thermal\nfluctuations and adhesive interactions. In contrast to earlier approaches, our\nmodel not only includes stochastic rules for the formation and rupture of\nbonds, but also fully resolves both receptor and ligand positions. We identify\nfive different dynamic states of motion in regard to the translational and\nangular velocities of the cell. The transitions between the different states\nare mapped out in a dynamic state diagram as a function of the rates for bond\nformation and rupture. For example, as the cell starts to adhere under the\naction of bonds, its translational and angular velocities become synchronized\nand the dynamic state changes from slipping to rolling. We also investigate the\neffect of non-molecular parameters. In particular, we find that an increase in\nviscosity of the medium leads to a characteristic expansion of the region of\nstable rolling to the expense of the region of firm adhesion, but not to the\nexpense of the regions of free or transient motion. Our results can be used in\nan inverse approach to determine single bond parameters from flow chamber data\non rolling adhesion.\n",

        "abstract": "  Motivated by rolling adhesion of white blood cells in the vasculature, we\nstudy how cells move in linear shear flow above a wall to which they can adhere\nvia specific receptor-ligand bonds. Our computer simulations are based on a\nLangevin equation accounting for hydrodynamic interactions, thermal\nfluctuations and adhesive interactions. In contrast to earlier approaches, our\nmodel not only includes stochastic rules for the formation and rupture of\nbonds, but also fully resolves both receptor and ligand positions. We identify\nfive different dynamic states of motion in regard to the translational and\nangular velocities of the cell. The transitions between the different states\nare mapped out in a dynamic state diagram as a function of the rates for bond\nformation and rupture. For example, as the cell starts to adhere under the\naction of bonds, its translational and angular velocities become synchronized\nand the dynamic state changes from slipping to rolling. We also investigate the\neffect of non-molecular parameters. In particular, we find that an increase in\nviscosity of the medium leads to a characteristic expansion of the region of\nstable rolling to the expense of the region of firm adhesion, but not to the\nexpense of the regions of free or transient motion. Our results can be used in\nan inverse approach to determine single bond parameters from flow chamber data\non rolling adhesion.\n",

        "abstract": "  Blood leukocytes can exhibit extensive morphological changes during their\npassage through small capillary vessels. The human monocytic THP-1 cell line\nwas used to explore the metabolic dependence of these shape changes. Cells were\naspirated into micropipettes for determination of the rate of protrusion\nformation. They were then released and the kinetics of morphological recovery\nwas studied. Results were consistent with Evans' model (Blood, 64 : 1028, 1984)\nof a viscous liquid droplet surrounded by a tensile membrane. The estimated\nvalues of cytoplasmic viscosity and membrane tension were 162 Pa.s and 0.0142\nmillinewton/m respectively. The influence of metabolic inhibitors on cell\nmechanical behaviour was then studied : results strongly suggested that\ndeformation involved two sequential phases. The cell elongation rate measured\nduring the first 30 seconds following the onset of aspiration was unaffected by\nazide, an inhibitor of energy production, and it was about doubled by\ncytochalasin D, a microfilament inhibitor, and colchicine, a microtubule\ninhibitor. However, during the following two minutes, deformation was almost\nabolished in cells treated with azide and cytochalasin D, whereas the\nprotrusion of control cells exhibited about threefold length increase. It is\nconcluded that, although cells seemed to deform as passive objects, active\nmetabolic processes were required to allow extensive morphological changes\ntriggered by external forces.\n",

We found that proteins by virtue of\nbeing characterised by high amount of clustering, are small-world networks.\nApart from the small-world nature, we found that proteins have another general\nproperty, viz., assortativity. This is an interesting and exceptional finding\nas all other complex networks (except for social networks) are known to be\ndisassortative.

We investigated native\nstate structures of 30 single-domain, two-state proteins, from complex networks\nperspective, to understand the role of topological parameters in proteins'\nfolding kinetics, at two length scales-- as ``Protein Contact Networks (PCNs)''\nand their corresponding ``Long-range Interaction Networks (LINs)'' constructed\nby ignoring the short-range interactions. Our results show that, both PCNs and\nLINs exhibit the exceptional topological property of ``assortative mixing''\nthat is absent in all other biological and technological networks studied so\nfar. We show that the degree distribution of these contact networks is partly\nresponsible for the observed assortativity. The coefficient of assortativity\nalso shows a positive correlation with the rate of protein folding at both\nshort and long contact scale, whereas, the clustering coefficients of only the\nLINs exhibit a negative correlation. The results indicate that the general\ntopological parameters of these naturally-evolved protein networks can\neffectively represent the structural and functional properties required for\nfast information transfer among the residues facilitating biochemical/kinetic\nfunctions, such as, allostery, stability, and the rate of folding.\n",

        "abstract": "  Boolean networks have been the object of much attention, especially since S.\nKauffman proposed them in the 1960's as models for gene regulatory networks.\nThese systems are characterized by being defined on a Boolean state space and\nby simultaneous updating at discrete time steps. Of particular importance for\nbiological applications are networks in which the indegree for each variable is\nbounded by a fixed constant, as was stressed by Kauffman in his original\npapers.\n  An important question is which conditions on the network topology can rule\nout exponentially long periodic orbits in the system. In this paper, we\nconsider systems with positive feedback interconnections among all variables\n(known as cooperative systems), which in a continuous setting guarantees a very\nstable dynamics. We show that for an arbitrary constant 0<c<2 and sufficiently\nlarge n there exist n-dimensional cooperative Boolean networks in which both\nthe indegree and outdegree of each variable is bounded by two, and which\nnevertheless contain periodic orbits of length at least c^n. In Part II of this\npaper we will prove an inverse result showing that any system with such a\ndynamic behavior must in a sense be similar to the example described.\n",

        "abstract": "  We aim to understand the formation of abnormal waves of activity from\nmyocardial regions with diminished cell-to-cell coupling. In route to this\ngoal, we studied the behavior of a heterogeneous myocyte network in which a\nsharp coupling gradient was placed under conditions of increasing network\nautomaticity. Experiments were conducted in monolayers of neonatal rat\ncardiomyocytes using heptanol and isoproterenol as means of altering\ncell-to-cell coupling and automaticity respectively. Experimental findings were\nexplained and expanded using a modified Beeler-Reuter numerical model. The data\nsuggests that the combination of a heterogeneous substrate, a gradient of\ncoupling and an increase in oscillatory activity of individual cells creates a\nrich set of behaviors associated with self-generated spiral waves and ectopic\nsources. Spiral waves feature a flattened shape and a pin-unpin drift type of\ntip motion. These intercellular waves are action-potential based and can be\nvisualized with either voltage or calcium transient measurements. A source/load\nmismatch on the interface between the boundary and well-coupled layers can lock\nwavefronts emanating from both ectopic sources and rotating waves within the\ninner layers of the coupling gradient. A numerical approach allowed us to\nexplore how: i) the spatial distribution of cells, ii) the amplitude and\ndispersion of cell automaticity, iii) and the speed at which the coupling\ngradient moves in space, affects wave behavior, including its escape into\nwell-coupled tissue.\n",

        "abstract": "  Experiments in recent years have vividly demonstrated that gene expression\ncan be highly stochastic. How protein concentration fluctuations affect the\ngrowth rate of a population of cells, is, however, a wide open question. We\npresent a mathematical model that makes it possible to quantify the effect of\nprotein concentration fluctuations on the growth rate of a population of\ngenetically identical cells. The model predicts that the population's growth\nrate depends on how the growth rate of a single cell varies with protein\nconcentration, the variance of the protein concentration fluctuations, and the\ncorrelation time of these fluctuations. The model also predicts that when the\naverage concentration of a protein is close to the value that maximizes the\ngrowth rate, fluctuations in its concentration always reduce the growth rate.\nHowever, when the average protein concentration deviates sufficiently from the\noptimal level, fluctuations can enhance the growth rate of the population, even\nwhen the growth rate of a cell depends linearly on the protein concentration.\nThe model also shows that the ensemble or population average of a quantity,\nsuch as the average protein expression level or its variance, is in general not\nequal to its time average as obtained from tracing a single cell and its\ndescendants. We apply our model to perform a cost-benefit analysis of gene\nregulatory control. Our analysis predicts that the optimal expression level of\na gene regulatory protein is determined by the trade-off between the cost of\nsynthesizing the regulatory protein and the benefit of minimizing the\nfluctuations in the expression of its target gene. We discuss possible\nexperiments that could test our predictions.\n",

We present here a theoretical approach to study generically a single\nvirus or DNA particle trafficking in a cell cytoplasm. Cellular trafficking has\nbeen studied experimentally mostly at the macroscopic level, but very little\nhas been done so far at the microscopic level. We present here a physical model\nto account for certain aspects of cellular organization, starting with the\nobservation that a viral particle trajectory consists of epochs of pure\ndiffusion and epochs of active transport along microtubules. We define a\ngeneral degradation rate to describe the limitations of the delivery of plasmid\nor viral particles to the nucleus imposed by various types of direct and\nindirect hydrolysis activity inside the cytoplasm. Following a homogenization\nprocedure, which consists of replacing the switching dynamics by a single\nsteady state stochastic description, not only can we study the spatio-temporal\ndynamics of moving objects in the cytosol, but also estimate the probability\nand the mean time to go from the cell membrane to a nuclear pore. Computational\nsimulations confirm that our model can be used to analyze and interpret viral\ntrajectories and estimate quantitatively the success of nuclear delivery.\n",

We\nassess the role of two pairs of reactions that influence the stability of these\nswitches: TF-TF homodimerisation and TF-DNA association/dissociation. We\nfactorise the flipping rate k into the product of the probability rho(q*) of\nfinding the system at the dividing surface (separatrix) between the two stable\nstates, and a kinetic prefactor R. In the case of the exclusive switch, the\nrate of TF-operator binding affects both rho(q*) and R, while the rate of TF\ndimerisation affects only R. In the case of the general switch both TF-operator\nbinding and TF dimerisation affect k, R and rho(q*). To elucidate this, we\nanalyse the transition state ensemble (TSE). For the exclusive switch, varying\nthe rate of TF-operator binding can drastically change the pathway of\nswitching, while changing the rate of dimerisation changes the switching rate\nwithout altering the mechanism. The switching pathways of the general switch\nare highly robust to changes in the rate constants of both TF-operator and\nTF-TF binding, even though these rate constants do affect the flipping rate;\nthis feature is unique for non-equilibrium systems.\n",

        "abstract": "  In many stochastic simulations of biochemical reaction networks, it is\ndesirable to ``coarse-grain'' the reaction set, removing fast reactions while\nretaining the correct system dynamics. Various coarse-graining methods have\nbeen proposed, but it remains unclear which methods are reliable and which\nreactions can safely be eliminated. We address these issues for a model gene\nregulatory network that is particularly sensitive to dynamical fluctuations: a\nbistable genetic switch. We remove protein-DNA and/or protein-protein\nassociation-dissociation reactions from the reaction set, using various\ncoarse-graining strategies. We determine the effects on the steady-state\nprobability distribution function and on the rate of fluctuation-driven switch\nflipping transitions. We find that protein-protein interactions may be safely\neliminated from the reaction set, but protein-DNA interactions may not. We also\nfind that it is important to use the chemical master equation rather than\nmacroscopic rate equations to compute effective propensity functions for the\ncoarse-grained reactions.\n",

Towards\ndeveloping more effective therapeutics against cancer, studies began to explore\nmore than a decade ago how natural tumor suppression could be translated into\nantineoplastic drugs. To this end, investigators focused on major constituents\nof a central pathway that protects cells against neoplastic transformation: the\nnuclear retinoblastoma protein (RB) pathway. As such, peptide mimetics of RB,\np16 and p21 were developed. Likewise, the p53 and von Hippel-Lindau gene\nproducts which affect indirectly the RB pathway provided additional templates\nfor the development of anti-proliferative peptides. Each of the peptides\nderived from these distinct tumor suppressors was made cell-permeable by its\nligation to an amino acid sequence conferring cellular internalization. Details\nreviewed here reveal that through the application of such anti-cancer peptide\ntherapeutics alone or in conjunction whenever synergy is to expect, the dark\nera of chemotherapy will likely be overcome, at last.\n",

The model is based on experimentally motivated interaction\nnetwork topologies, and is designed to capture some key statistics of gene\nexpression statistics. We impose a non-linearity to the system by a boundary\ncondition which guarantees non-negative concentrations of chemical\nconcentrations and study the system stability quantified by maximum Lyapunov\nexponents. We find that the non-negativity constraint leads to a drastic\ninflation of those regions in parameter space where the Lyapunov exponent\nexactly vanishes. We explain the finding as a self-organized critical\nphenomenon. The robustness of this finding with respect to different network\ntopologies and the role of intrinsic molecular- and external noise is\ndiscussed. We argue that systems with inflated 'edges of chaos' could be much\nmore easily favored by natural selection than systems where the Lyapunov\nexponent vanishes only on a parameter set of measure zero.\n",

These results indicate that bifan motifs in\ncell signaling networks can contribute to signal processing capability both\nintrinsically and by enabling the functions of other regulatory motifs.\n",

The\navian optic tectum is reciprocally connected with the nucleus isthmi.\nExtracellular stimulation combined with intracellular recordings reveal a range\nof signal delays from 4 to 9 ms between isthmotectal elements. This observation\ntogether with prior mathematical analysis concerning the influence of a delay\ndistribution on system dynamics raises the question whether a broad delay\ndistribution can impact the dynamics of neural feedback loops. For a system of\nreciprocally connected model neurons, we found that distributed delays enhance\nsystem stability in the following sense. With increased distribution of delays,\nthe system converges faster to a fixed point and converges slower toward a\nlimit cycle. Further, the introduction of distributed delays leads to an\nincreased range of the average delay value for which the system's equilibrium\npoint is stable. The enhancement of stability with increasing delay\ndistribution is caused by the introduction of smaller delays rather than the\ndistribution per se.\n",

        "abstract": "  This paper presents an interesting experimental example of voter-model\nstatistics in biology. In recent work on mouse tail-skin, where proliferating\ncells are confined to a two-dimensional layer, we showed that cells proliferate\nand differentiate according to a simple stochastic model of cell division\ninvolving just one type of proliferating cell that may divide both\nsymmetrically and asymmetrically. Curiously, these simple rules provide\nexcellent predictions of the cell population dynamics without having to address\ntheir spatial distribution. Yet, if the spatial behaviour of cells is addressed\nby allowing cells to diffuse at random, one deduces that density fluctuations\ndestroy tissue confluence, implying some hidden degree of spatial regulation in\nthe physical system. To infer the mechanism of spatial regulation, we consider\na two-dimensional model of cell fate that preserves the overall population\ndynamics. By identifying the resulting behaviour with a three-species variation\nof the \"Voter\" model, we predict that proliferating cells in the basal layer\nshould cluster. Analysis of empirical correlations of cells stained for\nproliferation activity confirms that the expected clustering behaviour is\nindeed seen in nature.\n",

They are critical in neuroendocrine system to maintain bodily\nhealthiness, emotional stabilization and endocrine harmony. The average act\ndegree of neuroendocrine network is h = 3.01, It means each mediator is\nsecreted by three cells on an average . The similarity that stand for the\naverage probability of secreting the same mediators by all the neuroendocrine\ncells is s = 0.14.

The\nmodels consider the time that elapses from the moment an enzyme-substrate\ncomplex forms until the moment a product molecule is released, as well as the\nrecovery time needed to reset the conformational change that took place. In the\nfirst model the dynamics is described by a set of delayed differential\nequations, instead of the ordinary differential equations associated to\nMichaelis-Menten kinetics. In the second model the delay, the discretization\ninherent to enzyme reactions and the stochastic binding of substrates to\nenzimes at the molecular level is considered. All three models agree at\nequilibrium, as expected; however, out-of-equilibrium dynamics can differ\nsubstantially. In particular, both delayed models show oscillations at low\nvalues of the Michaelis constant which are not reproduced by the\nMichaelis-Menten model. Additionally, in certain cases, the dynamics shown by\nthe continuous delayed model differs from the dynamics of the discrete delayed\nmodel when some reactant become scarce.\n",

For determining each\ncell type, cell-cell interactions are often essential, in addition to\nintracellular gene expression dynamics. Based on dynamical systems theory, we\npropose a mechanism for cell differentiation with regulation of populations of\neach cell type by taking simple cell models with gene expression dynamics. By\nincorporating several interaction kinetics, we found that the cell models with\na single intracellular positive-feedback loop exhibit a cell fate switching,\nwith a change in the total number of cells. The number of a given cell type or\nthe population ratio of each cell type is preserved against the change in the\ntotal number of cells, depending on the form of cell-cell interaction. The\ndifferentiation is a result of bifurcation of cell states via the intercellular\ninteractions, while the population regulation is explained by self-consistent\ndetermination of the bifurcation parameter through cell-cell interactions. The\nrelevance of this mechanism to development and differentiation in several\nmulticellular systems is discussed.\n",

The detailed knowledge of this code\ncontrasts the ignorance of the fiber structure which it regulates, and none of\nthe suggested fiber models are capable of predicting the most basic quantities\nof the fiber (diameter, nucleosome line density, etc.). We address this\nthree-decade-old problem by constructing a simple geometrical model based on\nthe nucleosome shape alone. Without fit parameters we predict the observed\nproperties of the condensed chromatin fiber (e.g. its 30 nm diameter), the\nstructure, and how the fiber changes with varying nucleosome repeat length. Our\napproach further puts the plethora of previously suggested models within a\ncoherent framework, and opens the door to detailed studies of the interplay\nbetween chromatin structure and function.\n",

        "abstract": "  Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) provides dynamical access into\nthe complex functioning of the human brain, detailing the hemodynamic activity\nof thousands of voxels during hundreds of sequential time points. One approach\ntowards illuminating the connection between fMRI and cognitive function is\nthrough decoding; how do the time series of voxel activities combine to provide\ninformation about internal and external experience? Here we seek models of fMRI\ndecoding which are balanced between the simplicity of their interpretation and\nthe effectiveness of their prediction. We use signals from a subject immersed\nin virtual reality to compare global and local methods of prediction applying\nboth linear and nonlinear techniques of dimensionality reduction. We find that\nthe prediction of complex stimuli is remarkably low-dimensional, saturating\nwith less than 100 features. In particular, we build effective models based on\nthe decorrelated components of cognitive activity in the classically-defined\nBrodmann areas. For some of the stimuli, the top predictive areas were\nsurprisingly transparent, including Wernicke's area for verbal instructions,\nvisual cortex for facial and body features, and visual-temporal regions for\nvelocity. Direct sensory experience resulted in the most robust predictions,\nwith the highest correlation ($c \\sim 0.8$) between the predicted and\nexperienced time series of verbal instructions. Techniques based on non-linear\ndimensionality reduction (Laplacian eigenmaps) performed similarly. The\ninterpretability and relative simplicity of our approach provides a conceptual\nbasis upon which to build more sophisticated techniques for fMRI decoding and\noffers a window into cognitive function during dynamic, natural experience.\n",

        "abstract": "  Individual locations of many neuronal cell bodies (>10^4) are needed to\nenable statistically significant measurements of spatial organization within\nthe brain such as nearest-neighbor and microcolumnarity measurements. In this\npaper, we introduce an Automated Neuron Recognition Algorithm (ANRA) which\nobtains the (x,y) location of individual neurons within digitized images of\nNissl-stained, 30 micron thick, frozen sections of the cerebral cortex of the\nRhesus monkey. Identification of neurons within such Nissl-stained sections is\ninherently difficult due to the variability in neuron staining, the overlap of\nneurons, the presence of partial or damaged neurons at tissue surfaces, and the\npresence of non-neuron objects, such as glial cells, blood vessels, and random\nartifacts. To overcome these challenges and identify neurons, ANRA applies a\ncombination of image segmentation and machine learning. The steps involve\nactive contour segmentation to find outlines of potential neuron cell bodies\nfollowed by artificial neural network training using the segmentation\nproperties (size, optical density, gyration, etc.) to distinguish between\nneuron and non-neuron segmentations. ANRA positively identifies 86[5]% neurons\nwith 15[8]% error (mean[st.dev.]) on a wide range of Nissl-stained images,\nwhereas semi-automatic methods obtain 80[7]%/17[12]%. A further advantage of\nANRA is that it affords an unlimited increase in speed from semi-automatic\nmethods, and is computationally efficient, with the ability to recognize ~100\nneurons per minute using a standard personal computer. ANRA is amenable to\nanalysis of huge photo-montages of Nissl-stained tissue, thereby opening the\ndoor to fast, efficient and quantitative analysis of vast stores of archival\nmaterial that exist in laboratories and research collections around the world.\n",

For proteins binding to the\nspecific sites on the DNA and regulating transcription, the ability of the\nproteins to diffuse in one dimension by sliding along the length of the DNA, in\naddition to their diffusion in bulk solution, would seem to generate a larger\ntarget for DNA binding, consequently reducing the noise in the occupancy of the\nregulatory site. Here we show that this effect is largely cancelled by the\nenhanced temporal correlations in one dimensional diffusion. With realistic\nparameters, sliding along DNA has surprisingly little effect on the physical\nlimits to the precision of transcriptional regulation.\n",

Adleman [Adleman 1994] wrote the first paper in which\nDNA strands in a test tube were used to solve an instance of the Hamiltonian\npath problem. From [Adleman 1994], it is obviously indicated that for storing\ninformation in molecules of DNA allows for an information density of\napproximately 1 bit per cubic nm (nanometer) and a dramatic improvement over\nexisting storage media such as video tape which store information at a density\nof approximately 1 bit per 1012 cubic nanometers. This paper demonstrates that\nbiological operations can be applied to construct bio-molecular databases where\ndata records in relational tables are encoded as DNA strands. In order to\nachieve the goal, DNA algorithms are proposed to perform eight operations of\nrelational algebra (calculus) on bio-molecular relational databases, which\ninclude Cartesian product, union, set difference, selection, projection,\nintersection, join and division. Furthermore, this work presents clear evidence\nof the ability of molecular computing to perform data retrieval operations on\nbio-molecular relational databases.\n",

        "abstract": "  Natively unstructured proteins defy the classical \"one sequence-one\nstructure\" paradigm of protein science. Monomers of these proteins in\npathological conditions can aggregate in the cell, a process that underlies\nsocially relevant neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and Parkinson. A\nfull comprehension of the formation and structure of the so-called misfolded\nintermediates from which the aggregated states ensue is still lacking. We\ncharacterized the folding and the conformational diversity of alpha-synuclein\n(aSyn), a natively unstructured protein involved in Parkinson disease, by\nmechanically stretching single molecules of this protein and recording their\nmechanical properties. These experiments permitted us to directly observe\ndirectly and quantify three main classes of conformations that, under in vitro\nphysiological conditions, exist simultaneously in the aSyn sample, including\ndisordered and \"beta-like\" structures. We found that this class of \"beta-like\"\nstructures is directly related to aSyn aggregation. In fact, their relative\nabundance increases drastically in three different conditions known to promote\nthe formation of aSyn fibrils: the presence of Cu2+, the occurrence of the\npathogenic A30P mutation, and high ionic strength. We expect that a critical\nconcentration of aSyn with a \"beta-like\" structure must be reached to trigger\nfibril formation. This critical concentration is therefore controlled by a\nchemical equilibrium. Novel pharmacological strategies can now be tailored to\nact upstream, before the aggregation process ensues, by targeting this\nequilibrium. To this end, Single Molecule Force Spectroscopy can be an\neffective tool to tailor and test new pharmacological agents.\n",

We show that the uncertainty in the state of each node can be\nexpressed as a sum of information quantities involving a growing number of\ncorrelated variables at other nodes. We demonstrate that each term in this sum\nis generated by successively conditioning mutual informations on new measured\nvariables, in a way analogous to a discrete differential calculus. The analogy\nto a Taylor series suggests efficient search algorithms for determining the\nstate of a target variable in terms of functional groups of other degrees of\nfreedom. We apply this methodology to electrophysiological recordings of\nnetworks of cortical neurons grown it in vitro. Despite strong stochasticity,\nwe show that each cell's patterns of firing are generally explained by the\nactivity of a small number of other neurons. We identify these neuronal\nsubgraphs in terms of their mutually redundant or synergetic character and\nreconstruct neuronal circuits that account for the state of each target cell.\n",

This problem sits at the intersection of\nstatistical physics and machine learning, and we suggest that more efficient\nsolutions are possible by merging ideas from the two fields. We use a\ncombination of recent coordinate descent algorithms with an adaptation of the\nhistogram Monte Carlo method, and implement these techniques to take advantage\nof the sparseness found in data on real neurons. The resulting algorithm learns\nthe parameters of an Ising model describing a network of forty neurons within a\nfew minutes.

        "abstract": "  As the past decade barely dawned, a fundamentally novel view of cancer\nrelating to signal transduction through intracellular hormones/growth factors\nand their subunits began to unfold. Further along, it gained additional\nsubstance with the advent of the interdisciplinary fields of particle biology\nand peptide strings which explain (onco)protein dynamics in spacetime, for\ninstance insulin-driven sub- and trans-cellular carcinogenesis, by physical\nprinciples. Here, this new understanding is expanded to introduce the concept\nof \"oncoprotein metastasis\" preceding cancer cell spread and, thereby, a\nparticular emphasis is placed on its potential role in the emergence of the\npre-metastatic niche. Consistent with this perception, yet unlike currently\nadvocated treatments that target cancer cells only, future antineoplastic\nstrategies should aim to mimic natural tumor suppressors as well as involve\nboth (morphologically) normal and malignant cells. If validated in human\npatients with advanced cancer disease, its otherwise frequently lethal course\nmay be halted and reversed just in time.\n",

We demonstrate that the cycle can actually operate in\nfour different regimes, each with its specific input-output characteristics.\nThese results are obtained using the total quasi-steady-state approximation,\nwhich is more generally valid than the typically used Michaelis-Menten\napproximation for enzymatic reactions. We invoke experimental data that\nsuggests the possibility of signaling cycles operating in one of the new\nregimes.\n  We then consider the cycle's dynamic behavior, which has so far been\nrelatively neglected. We demonstrate that the intrinsic architecture of the\ncycles makes them act - in all four regimes - as tunable low-pass filters,\nfiltering out high-frequency fluctuations or noise in signals and environmental\ncues. Moreover, the cutoff frequency can be adjusted by the cell. Numerical\nsimulations show that our analytical results hold well even for noise of large\namplitude. We suggest that noise filtering and tunability make signaling cycles\nversatile components of more elaborate cell signaling pathways.\n",

Based on the main physical\nproperties of the cellular transport machinery such as microtubules, motor\nproteins, our goal here is to derive a mathematical model to study cytoplasmic\ntrafficking. Because experimental results reveal that both active and passive\nmovement are necessary for a virus to reach the cell nucleus, by taking into\naccount the complex interactions of the virus with the microtubules, we derive\nhere an estimate of the mean time a virus reaches the nucleus. In particular,\nwe present a mathematical procedure in which the complex viral movement,\noscillating between pure diffusion and a deterministic movement along\nmicrotubules, can be approximated by a steady state stochastic equation with a\nconstant effective drift. An explicit expression for the drift amplitude is\ngiven as a function of the real drift, the density of microtubules and other\nphysical parameters. The present approach can be used to model viral\ntrafficking inside the cytoplasm, which is a fundamental step of viral\ninfection, leading to viral replication and in some cases to cell damage.\n",

It says that if the amount of information contained in a signal\nis smaller than the channel capacity of a physical media of communication, it\ncan be transmitted with arbitrarily small probability of error. This theorem is\nusually applicable to ideal channels of communication in which the information\nto be transmitted does not alter the passive characteristics of the channel\nthat basically tries to reproduce the source of information. For an {\\it active\nchannel}, a network formed by elements that are dynamical systems (such as\nneurons, chaotic or periodic oscillators), it is unclear if such theorem is\napplicable, once an active channel can adapt to the input of a signal, altering\nits capacity. To shed light into this matter, we show, among other results, how\nto calculate the information capacity of an active channel of communication.\nThen, we show that the {\\it channel capacity} depends on whether the active\nchannel is self-excitable or not and that, contrary to a current belief,\ndesynchronization can provide an environment in which large amounts of\ninformation can be transmitted in a channel that is self-excitable. An\ninteresting case of a self-excitable active channel is a network of\nelectrically connected Hindmarsh-Rose chaotic neurons.\n",

A normal MT consists of 13 protofilaments\non which the equispaced motor binding sites form a periodic array. The\ncollective movement of the kinesins on a MT is, therefore, analogous to\nvehicular traffic on multi-lane highways where each protofilament is the\nanalogue of a single lane. Does lane-changing increase or decrease the motor\nflux per lane? We address this fundamental question here by appropriately\nextending a recent model [{\\it Phys. Rev. E {\\bf 75}, 041905 (2007)}]. By\ncarrying out analytical calculations and computer simulations of this extended\nmodel, we predict that the flux per lane can increase or decrease with the\nincreasing rate of lane changing, depending on the concentrations of motors and\nthe rate of hydrolysis of ATP, the ``fuel'' molecules. Our predictions can be\ntested, in principle, by carrying out {\\it in-vitro} experiments with\nfluorescently labelled KIF1A molecules.\n",

We\nsuggest that an organism which maximizes the (biologically meaningful) adaptive\nvalue of its actions given fixed resources should have internal representations\nof the outside world that are optimal in a very specific information theoretic\nsense: they maximize the information about the future of sensory inputs at a\nfixed value of the information about their past. This principle contains as\nspecial cases computations which the brain seems to carry out, and it should be\npossible to test this optimization directly.

        "abstract": "  Synchronization phenomena are pervasive in biology. In neuronal networks, the\nmechanisms of synchronization have been extensively studied from both\nphysiological and computational viewpoints. The functional role of\nsynchronization has also attracted much interest and debate. In particular,\nsynchronization may allow distant sites in the brain to communicate and\ncooperate with each other, and therefore it may play a role in temporal binding\nand in attention and sensory-motor integration mechanisms.\n  In this article, we study another role for synchronization: the so-called\n\"collective enhancement of precision.\" We argue, in a full nonlinear dynamical\ncontext, that synchronization may help protect interconnected neurons from the\ninfluence of random perturbations -- intrinsic neuronal noise -- which affect\nall neurons in the nervous system. This property may allow reliable\ncomputations to be carried out even in the presence of significant noise (as\nexperimentally found e.g., in retinal ganglion cells in primates), as\nmathematically it is key to obtaining meaningful downstream signals, whether in\nterms of precisely-timed interaction (temporal coding), population coding, or\nfrequency coding. Using stochastic contraction theory, we show how\nsynchronization of nonlinear dynamical systems helps protect these systems from\nrandom perturbations.\n  Our main contribution is a mathematical proof that, under specific quantified\nconditions, the impact of noise on each individual system and on the spatial\nmean can essentially be cancelled through synchronization. Similar concepts may\nbe applicable to questions in systems biology.\n",

Thus, this individual is no longer represented\nby its complete sequence or genotype. An example of the efficiency of the new\nmodel with respect to a more classical forward one is demonstrated.

The differences\nare independent of the number of molecules of each species in the system under\nconsideration. These reaction networks are open systems of chemical reactions\nwith no zero-order reaction rates systems. They are characterized by at least\ntwo stationary points, one of which is a nonzero stable point, and one unstable\ntrivial solution (stability based on a linear stability analysis of the\ndeterministic system). Starting from a nonzero initial condition, the\ndeterministic system never reaches the zero stationary point due to its\nunstable nature. In contrast, the result presented here proves that this\nzero-state is the only stable stationary state for the discrete stochastic\nsystem. This result generalizes previous theoretical studies and simulations of\nspecific systems and provides a theoretical basis for analyzing a class of\nsystems that exhibit such inconsistent behavior. This result has implications\nin the simulation of infection, apoptosis, and population kinetics, as it can\nbe shown that for certain models the stochastic simulations will always yield\ndifferent predictions for the mean behavior than the deterministic simulations.\n",

In this model, the neural firing rate is a nonlinear function of a small\nnumber of relevant stimulus components. The relevant stimulus dimensions can be\nfound by maximizing one of the family of objective functions, Renyi divergences\nof different orders. We show that maximizing one of them, Renyi divergence of\norder 2, is equivalent to least-square fitting of the linear-nonlinear model to\nneural data. Next, we derive reconstruction errors in relevant dimensions found\nby maximizing Renyi divergences of arbitrary order in the asymptotic limit of\nlarge spike numbers. We find that the smallest rrors are obtained with Renyi\ndivergence of order 1, also known as Kullback-Leibler divergence. This\ncorresponds to finding relevant dimensions by maximizing mutual information. We\nnumerically test how these optimization schemes perform in the regime of low\nsignal-to-noise ratio (small number of spikes and increasing neural noise) for\nmodel visual neurons. We find that optimization schemes based on either least\nsquare fitting or information maximization perform well even when number of\nspikes is small. Information maximization provides slightly, but significantly,\nbetter reconstructions than least square fitting. This makes the problem of\nfinding relevant dimensions, together with the problem of lossy compression,\none of examples where information-theoretic measures are no more data limited\nthan those derived from least squares.\n",

This algorithm\nenables precise measurement and feature extraction of nematode movement\ncomponents. In addition, we develop a Graphical User Interface designed to\nfacilitate processing and interpretation of movement data. While, in this\nstudy, we focus on the simple sinusoidal locomotion of C. elegans, our approach\ncan be readily adapted to handle complicated locomotory behaviour patterns by\nincluding additional movement characteristics and parameters subject to\nquantification. Our software tool offers the capacity to extract, analyze and\nmeasure nematode locomotion features by processing simple video files. By\nallowing precise and quantitative assessment of behavioral traits, this tool\nwill assist the genetic dissection and elucidation of the molecular mechanisms\nunderlying specific behavioral responses.\n",

        "abstract": "  During batch growth on mixtures of two growth-limiting substrates, microbes\nconsume the substrates either sequentially or simultaneously. These growth\npatterns are manifested in all types of bacteria and yeasts. The ubiquity of\nthese growth patterns suggests that they are driven by a universal mechanism\ncommon to all microbial species. In previous work, we showed that a minimal\nmodel accounting only for enzyme induction and dilution explains the phenotypes\nobserved in batch cultures of various wild-type and mutant/recombinant cells.\nHere, we examine the extension of the minimal model to continuous cultures. We\nshow that: (1) Several enzymatic trends, usually attributed to specific\nregulatory mechanisms such as catabolite repression, are completely accounted\nfor by dilution. (2) The bifurcation diagram of the minimal model for\ncontinuous cultures, which classifies the substrate consumption pattern at any\ngiven dilution rate and feed concentrations, provides a a precise explanation\nfor the empirically observed correlation between the growth patterns in batch\nand continuous cultures. (3) Numerical simulations of the model are in\nexcellent agreement with the data. The model captures the variation of the\nsteady state substrate concentrations, cell densities, and enzyme levels during\nthe single- and mixed-substrate growth of bacteria and yeasts at various\ndilution rates and feed concentrations. (4) This variation is well-approximated\nby simple analytical expressions that furnish physical insights into the steady\nstates of continuous cultures. The minimal model provides a framework for\nquantitating the effect of regulatory mechanisms. We illustrate this by\nanalyzing several data sets from the literature.\n",

        "abstract": "  Through evolution, animals have acquired central nervous systems (CNSs),\nwhich are extremely efficient information processing devices that improve an\nanimal's adaptability to various environments. It has been proposed that the\nprocess of information maximization (infomax), which maximizes the information\ntransmission from the input to the output of a feedforward network, may provide\nan explanation of the stimulus selectivity of neurons in CNSs. However, CNSs\ncontain not only feedforward but also recurrent synaptic connections, and\nlittle is known about information retention over time in such recurrent\nnetworks. Here, we propose a learning algorithm based on infomax in a recurrent\nnetwork, which we call \"recurrent infomax\" (RI). RI maximizes information\nretention and thereby minimizes information loss in a network. We find that\nfeeding in external inputs consisting of information obtained from photographs\nof natural scenes into an RI-based model of a recurrent network results in the\nappearance of Gabor-like selectivity quite similar tothat existing in simple\ncells of the primary visual cortex (V1). More importantly, we find that without\nexternal input, this network exhibits cell assembly-like and synfire chain-like\nspontaneous activity and a critical neuronal avalanche. RI provides a simple\nframework to explain a wide range of phenomena observed in in vivo and in vitro\nneuronal networks, and it should provide a novel understanding of experimental\nresults for multineuronal activity and plasticity from an information-theoretic\npoint of view.\n",

We extend the classical Oja unsupervised model of\nlearning by a single linear neuron to include Hebbian inspecificity, by\nintroducing an error matrix E, which expresses possible crosstalk between\nupdating at different connections. We show the modified algorithm converges to\nthe leading eigenvector of the matrix EC, where C is the input covariance\nmatrix. When there is no inspecificity, this gives the classical result of\nconvergence to the first principal component of the input distribution (PC1).\nWe then study the outcome of learning using different versions of E. In the\nmost biologically plausible case, arising when there are no intrinsically\nprivileged connections, E has diagonal elements Q and off- diagonal elements\n(1-Q)/(n-1), where Q, the quality, is expected to decrease with the number of\ninputs n. We analyze this error-onto-all case in detail, for both uncorrelated\nand correlated inputs. We study the dependence of the angle theta between PC1\nand the leading eigenvector of EC on b, n and the amount of input activity or\ncorrelation. (We do this analytically and using Matlab calculations.) We find\nthat theta increases (learning becomes gradually less useful) with increases in\nb, particularly for intermediate (i.e. biologically-realistic) correlation\nstrength, although some useful learning always occurs up to the trivial limit Q\n= 1/n. We discuss the relation of our results to Hebbian unsupervised learning\nin the brain.\n",

        "abstract": "  This paper proposes a systemic perspective for some aspects of both\nphylogenesis and ontogenesis, in the light of the notion of biological\norganization as negative entropy, following some hints by Schroedinger. To this\npurpose, we introduce two extra principles to the thermodynamic ones, which are\n(mathematically) compatible with the traditional principles, but have no\nmeaning in inert matter. A traditional balance equation for metabolism will be\nthen extended to the new notion as specified by these principles. We consider\nfar from equilibrium systems and we focus in particular on the production of\nglobal entropy associated to the irreversible character of the processes. A\nclose analysis of this term will be carried on, both in terms of a diffusion\nequation of biomass over complexity and, as a complementary approach and as a\ntool for specifying a source term, in connection to Schroedinger's method for\nhis equation in Quantum Mechanics. We borrow from this equation just the\noperatorial approach and, this, in a classical frame, as we use real\ncoefficients instead of complex ones, away thus from the mathematical frame of\nquantum theories. The first application of our proposal is a simple\nmathematical reconstruction of Gould's complexity curve of biomass over\ncomplexity, as for evolution. We then elaborate, from the existence of\ndifferent time scales, a partition of ontogenetic time, in reference to entropy\nand negative entropy variation. On the grounds of this approach, we analyze\nmetabolism and scaling laws. This allows to compare various relevant\ncoefficients appearing in these scaling laws, which seem to fit empirical data.\nFinally, a tentative and quantitative evaluation of complexity is proposed,\nalso in relation to some empirical data (caenorhabditis elegans).\n",

The filamentary tracks, on which these\nmotors move, are made of either proteins (e.g., microtubules) or nucleic acids\n(DNA or RNA). Often, many such motors move simultaneously on the same track and\ntheir collective properties have superficial similarities with vehicular\ntraffic on highways. The models we have developed provide ``unified''\ndescription: in the low-density limit, a model captures the transport\nproperties of a single motor while, at higher densities the same model accounts\nfor the collective spatio-temporal organization of interacting motors. By\ndrawing analogy with vehicular traffic, we have introduced novel quantities for\ncharacterizing the nature of the spatio-temporal organization of molecular\nmotors on their tracks.

        "abstract": "  Background: The global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\nepidemic has clearly shown the importance of considering the long-range\ntransportation networks in the understanding of emerging diseases outbreaks.\nThe introduction of extensive transportation data sets is therefore an\nimportant step in order to develop epidemic models endowed with realism.\nMethods: We develop a general stochastic meta-population model that\nincorporates actual travel and census data among 3 100 urban areas in 220\ncountries. The model allows probabilistic predictions on the likelihood of\ncountry outbreaks and their magnitude. The level of predictability offered by\nthe model can be quantitatively analyzed and related to the appearance of\nrobust epidemic pathways that represent the most probable routes for the spread\nof the disease. Results: In order to assess the predictive power of the model,\nthe case study of the global spread of SARS is considered. The disease\nparameter values and initial conditions used in the model are evaluated from\nempirical data for Hong Kong. The outbreak likelihood for specific countries is\nevaluated along with the emerging epidemic pathways. Simulation results are in\nagreement with the empirical data of the SARS worldwide epidemic. Conclusions:\nThe presented computational approach shows that the integration of long-range\nmobility and demographic data provides epidemic models with a predictive power\nthat can be consistently tested and theoretically motivated. This computational\nstrategy can be therefore considered as a general tool in the analysis and\nforecast of the global spreading of emerging diseases and in the definition of\ncontainment policies aimed at reducing the effects of potentially catastrophic\noutbreaks.\n",

Different entropy production\nbetween two kinds of cells determines the direction of entropy flow among\ncells. The entropy flow is the carrier of information flow. The entropy flow\nfrom cancer to healthy cell takes along the harmful information of cancerous\ncell, propagating its toxic action to healthy tissues. We demonstrate that a\nlow-frequency and low-intensity electromagnetic field or ultrasound irradiation\nmay increase the entropy production rate of a cell in normal tissue than that\nin cancer, consequently reverse the direction of entropy current between two\nkinds of cells. The modification of PH value of cells may also cause the\nreversal of the direction of entropy flow between healthy and cancerous cells.\nSo, the biological tissue under the irradiation of electromagnetic field or\nultrasound or under the appropriate change of cell acidity can avoid the\npropagation of harmful information from cancer cells. We suggest that this\nentropy mechanism possibly provides a basis for a novel approach to anticancer\ntherapy.\n",

        "abstract": "  We have developed a mathematical model of regulation of expression of the\nEscherichia coli lac operon, and have investigated bistability in its\nsteady-state induction behavior in the absence of external glucose. Numerical\nanalysis of equations describing regulation by artificial inducers revealed two\nnatural bistability parameters that can be used to control the range of inducer\nconcentrations over which the model exhibits bistability. By tuning these\nbistability parameters, we found a family of biophysically reasonable systems\nthat are consistent with an experimentally determined bistable region for\ninduction by thio-methylgalactoside (Ozbudak et al. Nature 427:737, 2004). The\nmodel predicts that bistability can be abolished when passive transport or\npermease export becomes sufficiently large; the former case is especially\nrelevant to induction by isopropyl-beta, D-thiogalactopyranoside. To model\nregulation by lactose, we developed similar equations in which allolactose, a\nmetabolic intermediate in lactose metabolism and a natural inducer of lac, is\nthe inducer. For biophysically reasonable parameter values, these equations\nyield no bistability in response to induction by lactose; however, systems with\nan unphysically small permease-dependent export effect can exhibit small\namounts of bistability for limited ranges of parameter values. These results\ncast doubt on the relevance of bistability in the lac operon within the natural\ncontext of E. coli, and help shed light on the controversy among existing\ntheoretical studies that address this issue. The results also suggest an\nexperimental approach to address the relevance of bistability in the lac operon\nwithin the natural context of E. coli.\n",

        "abstract": "  In the presence of gratuitous inducers, the lac operon of Escherichia coli\nexhibits bistability. Most models in the literature assume that the inducer\nenters the cell via the carrier (permease), and exits by a diffusion-like\nprocess. The diffusive influx and carrier efflux are neglected. However,\nanalysis of the data shows that in non-induced cells, the diffusive influx is\ncomparable to the carrier influx, and in induced cells, the carrier efflux is 7\ntimes the diffusive efflux. Since bistability entails the coexistence of steady\nstates corresponding to both non-induced and induced cells, neither one of\nthese fluxes can be ignored. Here, we formulate a model accounting for both\nfluxes. We show that: (a) The thresholds of bistability are profoundly affected\nby both fluxes. The diffusive influx reduces the on threshold by enhancing\ninducer accumulation in non-induced cells. The carrier efflux increases the off\nthreshold by decreasing inducer accumulation in induced cells. (b) Simulations\nof the model with experimentally measured parameter values are in good\nagreement with the data for IPTG. However, there are discrepancies with respect\nto the data for TMG. They are most likely due to two features missing from the\nmodel, namely, the variation of the inducer exclusion effect and the specific\ngrowth rate with the lactose enzyme levels. (c) The steady states and\nthresholds obtained in the presence of both fluxes are well approximated by\nsimple analytical expressions, which may be useful for the preliminary design\nof the lac genetic switch in synthetic biology.\n",

Here, we\npropose for the first time an analytical model of transport limited reactions\nin active media, and show quantitatively how active transport can enhance\nreactivity for large enough tracers like vesicles. We derive analytically the\naverage interaction time with motor proteins which optimizes the reaction rate,\nand reveal remarkable universal features of the optimal configuration.

        "abstract": "  Phenotypic heterogeneity in an isogenic, microbial population enables a\nsubset of the population to persist under stress. In mycobacteria, stresses\nlike nutrient and oxygen deprivation activate the stress response pathway\ninvolving the two-component system MprAB and the sigma factor, SigE. SigE in\nturn activates the expression of the stringent response regulator, rel. The\nenzyme polyphosphate kinase 1 (PPK1) regulates this pathway by synthesizing\npolyphosphate required for the activation of MprB. The precise manner in which\nonly a subpopulation of bacterial cells develops persistence, remains unknown.\nRel is required for mycobacterial persistence. Here we show that the\ndistribution of rel expression levels in a growing population of mycobacteria\nis bimodal with two distinct peaks corresponding to low (L) and high (H)\nexpression states, and further establish that a positive feedback loop\ninvolving the mprAB operon along with stochastic gene expression are\nresponsible for the phenotypic heterogeneity. Combining single cell analysis by\nflow cytometry with theoretical modeling, we observe that during growth,\nnoise-driven transitions take a subpopulation of cells from the L to the H\nstate within a \"window of opportunity\" in time preceding the stationary phase.\nWe find evidence of hysteresis in the expression of rel in response to changing\nconcentrations of PPK1. Our results provide, for the first time, evidence that\nbistability and stochastic gene expression could be important for the\ndevelopment of \"heterogeneity with an advantage\" in mycobacteria.\n",

The normal form which has been recently\nproposed on phenomenological grounds is given in form of a differential delay\nequation. The normal form exhibits a symmetry preserving Hopf bifurcation which\nmay coalesce with a saddle-node in a Bogdanov-Takens point, and a symmetry\nbreaking spatially inhomogeneous pitchfork bifurcation. We study here the Hopf\nbifurcation for the propagation of a single pulse in a ring by means of a\ncenter manifold reduction, and for a wave train by means of a multiscale\nanalysis leading to a real Ginzburg-Landau equation as the corresponding\namplitude equation. Both, the center manifold reduction and the multiscale\nanalysis show that the Hopf bifurcation is always subcritical independent of\nthe parameters. This may have links to cardiac alternans which have so far been\nbelieved to be stable oscillations emanating from a supercritical bifurcation.\nWe discuss the implications for cardiac alternans and revisit the instability\nin some excitable media where the oscillations had been believed to be stable.\nIn particular, we show that our condition for the onset of the Hopf bifurcation\ncoincides with the well known restitution condition for cardiac alternans.\n",

Accompanying differences in signal duration are numerous\ndownstream biological processes that require multiple steps of biochemical\nregulation. Here, we present an analysis that investigates how simple\nbiochemical motifs that involve multiple stages of regulation can be\nconstructed to differentially process signals that persist at different time\nscales. We compute the dynamic gain within these networks and resulting power\nspectra to better understand how biochemical networks can integrate signals at\ndifferent time scales.

By further analyzing the\nstatics of filaments inside membrane tubes, and through computer simulations\nthat capture membrane and filament fluctuations, we show under which conditions\nfilopodia of arbitrary lengths are stable.

Their shape is determined by the stiffness of the actin filament\nbundles found inside them and by the interplay between the surface tension and\nbending rigidity of the membrane. Although one might expect the Euler buckling\ninstability to limit the length of filopodia, we show through simple energetic\nconsiderations that this is in general not the case. By further analyzing the\nstatics of filaments inside membrane tubes, and through computer simulations\nthat capture membrane and filament fluctuations, we show under which conditions\nfilopodia of arbitrary lengths are stable. We discuss several in vitro\nexperiments where this kind of stability has already been observed.\nFurthermore, we predict that the filaments in long, stable filopodia adopt a\nhelical shape.\n",

        "abstract": "  An important goal of medical research is to develop methods to recover the\nloss of cellular function due to mutations and other defects. Many approaches\nbased on gene therapy aim to repair the defective gene or to insert genes with\ncompensatory function. Here, we propose an alternative, network-based strategy\nthat aims to restore biological function by forcing the cell to either bypass\nthe functions affected by the defective gene, or to compensate for the lost\nfunction. Focusing on the metabolism of single-cell organisms, we\ncomputationally study mutants that lack an essential enzyme, and thus are\nunable to grow or have a significantly reduced growth rate. We show that\nseveral of these mutants can be turned into viable organisms through additional\ngene deletions that restore their growth rate. In a rather counterintuitive\nfashion, this is achieved via additional damage to the metabolic network. Using\nflux balance-based approaches, we identify a number of synthetically viable\ngene pairs, in which the removal of one enzyme-encoding gene results in a\nnonviable phenotype, while the deletion of a second enzyme-encoding gene\nrescues the organism. The systematic network-based identification of\ncompensatory rescue effects may open new avenues for genetic interventions.\n",

But despite considerable progress during the last years, many of its\naspects remain poorly understood. Experiments on lateral spreading of receptor\nactivity into ligand-free regions challenge the current standard models of EGFR\nactivation. Here, we propose and study a theoretical model, which explains\nspreading into ligand-free regions without introducing any new, unknown kinetic\nparameters. The model exhibits bistability of activity, induced by a generic\nreaction mechanism, which consists of activation via dimerization and\ndeactivation via a Michaelis-Menten reaction. It possesses slow propagating\nfront solutions and faster initial transients. We analyze relevant experiments\nand find that they are in quantitative accordance with the fast initial modes\nof spreading, but not with the slow propagating front. We point out that\nlateral spreading of activity is linked to pathological levels of persistent\nreceptor activity as observed in cancer cells and exemplify uses of this link\nfor the design and quick evaluation of molecular therapies targeting primary\nactivation of EGFR.\n",

        "abstract": "  The collective behavior of molecular motor proteins have been investigated in\nthe literature using models to describe the long-time dynamics of a\nunidimensional continuum motor distribution. Here, we consider the phenomena\nrelated to the transport of particles (vesicles, organelles, virus, etc) in the\nrealm of these continuum motor systems. We argue that cargo movement may result\nfrom its ability to perturb the existing motor distribution and to surf at the\nresulting shock waves separating regions of different motor densities within\nthe transient regime. In this case, the observed bidirectionality of cargo\nmovement is naturally associated with reversals of shocks directions.\nComparison of the quantitative results predicted by this model with available\ndata for cargo velocity allows us to suggest that geometrical characteristics\nof the transported particle shall determine the extension and intensity of the\nperturbation it produces and thus, its dynamics. Possible implications of these\nideas to virus movement at the cell body are discussed in connection with their\ndistinguished morphological characteristics. Key words: collective effects of\nmolecular motors; cargo transport; non-linear partial differential equations;\nshock waves.\n",

        "abstract": "  Budding from the plasma membrane of the host cell is an indispensable step in\nthe life cycle of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which belongs to a\nlarge family of enveloped RNA viruses, retroviruses. Unlike regular enveloped\nviruses, retrovirus budding happens {\\em concurrently} with the self-assembly\nof retrovirus protein subunits (Gags) into spherical virus capsids on the cell\nmembrane. Led by this unique budding and assembly mechanism, we study the free\nenergy profile of retrovirus budding, taking into account of the Gag-Gag\nattraction energy and the membrane elastic energy. We find that if the Gag-Gag\nattraction is strong, budding always proceeds to completion. During early stage\nof budding, the zenith angle of partial budded capsids, $\\alpha$, increases\nwith time as $\\alpha \\propto t^{1/3}$. However, when Gag-Gag attraction is\nweak, a metastable state of partial budding appears. The zenith angle of these\npartially spherical capsids is given by\n$\\alpha_0\\simeq(\\tau^2/\\kappa\\sigma)^{1/4}$ in a linear approximation, where\n$\\kappa$ and $\\sigma$ are the bending modulus and the surface tension of the\nmembrane, and $\\tau$ is a line tension of the capsid proportional to the\nstrength of Gag-Gag attraction. Numerically, we find $\\alpha_0<0.3\\pi$ without\nany approximations. Using experimental parameters, we show that HIV budding and\nassembly always proceed to completion in normal biological conditions. On the\nother hand, by changing Gag-Gag interaction strength or membrane rigidity, it\nis relatively easy to tune it back and forth between complete budding and\npartial budding. Our model agrees reasonably well with experiments observing\npartial budding of retroviruses including HIV.\n",

        "abstract": "  Algebraic properties of the genetic code are analyzed. The investigations of\nthe genetic code on the basis of matrix approaches (\"matrix genetics\") are\ndescribed. The degeneracy of the vertebrate mitochondria genetic code is\nreflected in the black-and-white mosaic of the (8*8)-matrix of 64 triplets, 20\namino acids and stop-signals. This mosaic genetic matrix is connected with the\nmatrix form of presentation of the special 8-dimensional Yin-Yang-algebra and\nof its particular 4-dimensional case. The special algorithm, which is based on\nfeatures of genetic molecules, exists to transform the mosaic genomatrix into\nthe matrices of these algebras. Two new numeric systems are defined by these\n8-dimensional and 4-dimensional algebras: genetic Yin-Yang-octaves and genetic\ntetrions. Their comparison with quaternions by Hamilton is presented. Elements\nof new \"genovector calculation\" and ideas of \"genetic mechanics\" are discussed.\nThese algebras are considered as models of the genetic code and as its possible\npre-code basis. They are related with binary oppositions of the Yin-Yang type\nand they give new opportunities to investigate evolution of the genetic code.\nThe revealed fact of the relation between the genetic code and these genetic\nalgebras is discussed in connection with the idea by Pythagoras: \"All things\nare numbers\". Simultaneously these genetic algebras can be utilized as the\nalgebras of genetic operators in biological organisms. The described results\nare related with the problem of algebraization of bioinformatics. They take\nattention to the question: what is life from the viewpoint of algebra?\n",

        "abstract": "  Eukaryotic cells are large enough to detect signals and then orient to them\nby differentiating the signal strength across the length and breadth of the\ncell. Amoebae, fibroblasts, neutrophils and growth cones all behave in this\nway. Little is known however about cell motion and searching behavior in the\nabsence of a signal. Is individual cell motion best characterized as a random\nwalk? Do individual cells have a search strategy when they are beyond the range\nof the signal they would otherwise move toward? Here we ask if single,\nisolated, Dictyostelium and Polysphondylium amoebae bias their motion in the\nabsence of external cues. We placed single well-isolated Dictyostelium and\nPolysphondylium cells on a nutrient-free agar surface and followed them at 10\nsec intervals for ~10 hr, then analyzed their motion with respect to velocity,\nturning angle, persistence length, and persistence time, comparing the results\nto the expectation for a variety of different types of random motion. We find\nthat amoeboid behavior is well described by a special kind of random motion:\nAmoebae show a long persistence time (~10 min) beyond which they start to lose\ntheir direction; they move forward in a zig-zag manner; and they make turns\nevery 1-2 min on average. They bias their motion by remembering the last turn\nand turning away from it. Interpreting the motion as consisting of runs and\nturns, the duration of a run and the amplitude of a turn are both found to be\nexponentially distributed. We show that this behavior greatly improves their\nchances of finding a target relative to performing a random walk. We believe\nthat other eukaryotic cells may employ a strategy similar to Dictyostelium when\nseeking conditions or signal sources not yet within range of their detection\nsystem.\n",

        "abstract": "  There is a whole range of emergent phenomena in non-equilibrium behaviors can\nbe well described by a set of stochastic differential equations. Inspired by an\ninsight gained during our study of robustness and stability in phage lambda\ngenetic switch in modern biology, we found that there exists a classification\nof generic nonequilibrium processes: In the continuous description in terms of\nstochastic differential equations, there exists four dynamical elements: the\npotential function $\\phi$, the friction matrix $ S$, the anti-symmetric matrix\n$ T $, and the noise. The generic feature of absence of detailed balance is\nthen precisely represented by $T$. For dynamical near a fixed point, whether or\nnot it is stable or not, the stochastic dynamics is linear. A rather complete\nanalysis has been carried out (Kwon, Ao, Thouless, cond-mat/0506280; PNAS, {\\bf\n102} (2005) 13029), referred to as SDS I. One important and persistent question\nis the existence of a potential function with nonlinear force and with\nmultiplicative noise, with both nice local dynamical and global steady state\nproperties. Here we demonstrate that a dynamical structure built into\nstochastic differential equation allows us to construct such a global\noptimization potential function. First, we provide the construction. One of\nmost important ingredient is the generalized Einstein relation. We then present\nan approximation scheme: The gradient expansion which turns every order into\nlinear matrix equations. The consistent of such methodology with other known\nstochastic treatments will be discussed in next paper, SDS III; and the\nexplicitly connection to statistical mechanics and thermodynamics will be\ndiscussed in a forthcoming paper, SDS IV.\n",

        "abstract": "  We present a novel flow instability that can arise in thin films of\ncytoskeletal fluids if the friction with the substrate on which the film lies\nis sufficiently strong. We consider a two dimensional, membrane-bound fragment\ncontaining actin filaments that is perturbed from its initially circular state,\nwhere actin polymerizes at the edge and flows radially inward while\ndepolymerizing in the fragment. Performing a linear stability analysis of the\ninitial state due to perturbations of the fragment boundary, we find, in the\nlimit of very large friction, that the perturbed actin velocity and pressure\nfields obey the very same laws governing the viscous fingering instability of\nan interface between immiscible fluids in a Hele-Shaw cell. A feature of this\ninstability that is remarkable in the context of cell motility, is that its\nexistence is independent of the strength of the interaction between\ncytoskeletal filaments and myosin motors, and moreover that it is completely\ndriven by the free energy of actin polymerization at the fragment edge.\n",

The number of accidental backsteps\nthat kinesin takes appears to be much larger than what one would expect given\nthe amount of free energy that ATP hydrolysis makes available. This is puzzling\nas more than a billion years of natural selection should have optimized the\nmotor protein for its speed and efficiency. But more backstepping allows for\nthe production of more entropy. Such entropy production will make free energy\navailable. With this additional free energy, the catalytic cycle of the kinesin\ncan be speeded up. We show how measured backstep percentages represent an\noptimum at which maximal net forward speed is achieved.\n",

        "abstract": "  Escherichia coli is a motile bacterium that moves up a chemoattractant\ngradient by performing a biased random walk composed of alternating runs and\ntumbles. This paper presents calculations of the chemotactic drift velocity vd\n(the mean velocity up the chemoattractant gradient) of an E. coli cell\nperforming chemotaxis in a uniform, steady shear flow, with a weak\nchemoattractant gradient at right angles to the flow. Extending earlier models,\na combined analytic and numerical approach is used to assess the effect of\nseveral complications, namely (i) a cell cannot detect a chemoattractant\ngradient directly but rather makes temporal comparisons of chemoattractant\nconcentration, (ii) the tumbles exhibit persistence of direction, meaning that\nthe swimming directions before and after a tumble are correlated, (iii) the\ncell suffers random re-orientations due to rotational Brownian motion, and (iv)\nthe non-spherical shape of the cell affects the way that it is rotated by the\nshear flow. These complications influence the dependence of vd on the shear\nrate gamma. When they are all included, it is found that (a) shear disrupts\nchemotaxis and shear rates beyond gamma = 2/second cause the cell to swim down\nthe chemoattractant gradient rather than up it, (b) in terms of maximising\ndrift velocity, persistence of direction is advantageous in a quiescent fluid\nbut disadvantageous in a shear flow, and (c) a more elongated body shape is\nadvantageous in performing chemotaxis in a strong shear flow.\n",

Cell diversity that observed during the differentiation\nthrough the different epidermal cell layers included the consisted changes of\ncell shape, intercellular contacts and proliferation. However, the most\ndramatically these changes appeared at the molecular level through gene\nexpression, catalysis and intraprotein interactions. The proposed review\nexplains these changes by switching systemic transcription factors that unlike\ntheir counterparts those role is limited to a contribution to gene expression\nalso prepare cells to the next step of differentiation via modification of the\nchromatin pattern . Since primary epidermal keratinocytes are one of the most\neasy available type of the stem cells, a better understanding of the epidermal\ndifferentiation will benefit the research in the other areas by a discovery of\nbasic coordinating mechanisms that stand behind such distinct molecular events\nas cell signaling and gene expression, and formulate basic principles for a\nsmart therapeutic correction of the metabolism.\n",

        "abstract": "  Random Boolean networks are models of disordered causal systems that can\noccur in cells and the biosphere. These are open thermodynamic systems\nexhibiting a flow of energy that is dissipated at a finite rate. Life does work\nto acquire more energy, then uses the available energy it has gained to perform\nmore work. It is plausible that natural selection has optimized many biological\nsystems for power efficiency: useful power generated per unit fuel. In this\nletter we begin to investigate these questions for random Boolean networks\nusing Landauer's erasure principle, which defines a minimum entropy cost for\nbit erasure. We show that critical Boolean networks maximize available power\nefficiency, which requires that the system have a finite displacement from\nequilibrium. Our initial results may extend to more realistic models for cells\nand ecosystems.\n",

The proposed method allows for predicting the\nasymmetric response of the genetic switch to noise, arising from the\nnoise-induced shift of stationary states. The method has been tested on an\nexample model of the lac operon regulatory network: a reduced Yildirim-Mackey\nmodel with fluctuating extracellular lactose concentration. We calculate\nanalytically the shift of the system's stationary states in the presence of\nnoise. The results of the analytical calculation are in excellent agreement\nwith the results of numerical simulation of the noisy system. The simulation\nresults suggest that the structure of the kinetics of the underlying\nbiochemical reactions protects the bistability of the lactose utilization\nmechanism from environmental fluctuations. We also show that, in the\nconsequence of the noise-induced shift of stationary states, the presence of\nfluctuations stabilizes the behavior of the system in a selective way: although\nthe extrinsic noise facilitates, to some extent, switching off the lactose\nmetabolism, the same noise prevents it from switching on.\n",

        "abstract": "  The problem of the directionality of genome evolution is studied from the\ninformation-theoretic view. We propose that the function-coding information\nquantity of a genome always grows in the course of evolution through sequence\nduplication, expansion of code, and gene transfer between genomes. The\nfunction-coding information quantity of a genome consists of two parts,\np-coding information quantity which encodes functional protein and n-coding\ninformation quantity which encodes other functional elements except amino acid\nsequence. The relation of the proposed law to the thermodynamic laws is\nindicated. The evolutionary trends of DNA sequences revealed by bioinformatics\nare investigated which afford further evidences on the evolutionary law. It is\nargued that the directionality of genome evolution comes from species\ncompetition adaptive to environment. An expression on the evolutionary rate of\ngenome is proposed that the rate is a function of Darwin temperature\n(describing species competition) and fitness slope (describing adaptive\nlandscape). Finally, the problem of directly experimental test on the\nevolutionary directionality is discussed briefly.\n",

It is based on a model of\ndevelopment, whose key features are: i) the distinction bewteen ``normal'' and\n``driver'' cells, being the latter able to receive guidance from the genome,\nii) the implementation of the proliferation/apoptosis events in such a way that\nmany cells are created/deleted at once, in order to speed-up the morphogenetic\nprocess. iii) the presence in driver cells of an epigenetic memory, that holds\nthe position of the cell in the cell lineage tree and represents the source of\ndifferentiation during development. The experiments performed with a number of\n100x100 black and white and colour target shapes (the horse, the couple, the\nhand, the dolphin, the map of Britain, the foot, the frog, the baby, the\nstomach, the french flag, the head) bring to the conclusion that the method\ndescribed is able to generate any target shape, outperforming any other known\nmethod in terms of size and variety of the generated shapes. The interpretation\nof the proposed method as a model of embryogenesis and its biological\nimplications are discussed.\n",

        "abstract": "  How does immune system evolve functional proteins - potent antibodies - in\nsuch a short time? We address this question using a microscopic, protein-level,\nsequence-based model of humoral immune response with explicitly defined\ninteractions between Immunoglobulins, host and pathogen proteins. Potent\nImmunoglobulins are discovered in this model via clonal selection and affinity\nmaturation. Possible outcomes of an infection (extinction of cells, survival\nwith complete elimination of viruses, or persistent infection) crucially depend\non mutation rates of viral and Immunoglobulin proteins. The model predicts that\nthere is an optimal Somatic Hypermutation (SHM) rate close to experimentally\nobserved 10-3 per nucleotide per replication. Further, we developed an\nanalytical theory which explains the physical reason for an optimal SHM program\nas a compromise between deleterious effects of random mutations on nascent\nmaturing Immunoglobulins (adversity) and the need to generate diverse pool of\nmutated antibodies from which highly potent ones can be drawn (diversity). The\ntheory explains such effects as dependence of B cell fate on affinity for an\nincoming antigen, ceiling in affinity of mature antibodies, Germinal Center\nsizes and maturation times. The theory reveals the molecular factors which\ndetermine the efficiency of affinity maturation, providing insight into\nvariability of immune response to cytopathic (direct response by germline\nantibodies) and poorly cytopathic viruses (crucial role of SHM in response).\nThese results demonstrate the feasibility and promise of microscopic\nsequence-based models of immune system, where population dynamics of evolving\nImmunoglobulins is explicitly tied to their molecular properties.\n",

I use 'fluctuation trapping' model\nas a general framework. I introduce notions of R-error and D-error and argue\nthat the 'fluctuation trapping' model has to employ a correlation between the\nR- and D- errors. Further, I compare how the two approaches can justify the\nR-D-error correlation, focusing on the advantages of the Q-cell approach. The\npositive role of environmentally induced decoherence (EID) on both steps of the\nadaptation process is emphasized. A starving bacterial cell is proposed to be\nin an einselected state. The intracellular dynamics in this state has a unitary\ncharacter and I propose to interpret it as 'exponential growth in imaginary\ntime', analogously to the commonly considered 'diffusion' interpretation of the\nSchroedinger equation. Addition of a substrate leads to Wick rotation and a\nswitch from 'imaginary time' reproduction to a 'real time' reproduction regime.\nDue to the variations at the genomic level (such as base tautomery), the\nstarving cell has to be represented as a superposition of different components,\nall 'reproducing in imaginary time'. Adidtion of a selective substrate,\nallowing only one of these components to amplify, will cause Wick rotation and\namplification of this component, thus justifying the occurence of the R-D-error\ncorrelation. Further ramifications of the proposed ideas for evolutionary\ntheory are discussed.\n",

        "abstract": "  We analyze the dynamics of rotary biomotors within a simple\nnano-electromechanical model, consisting of a stator part and a ring-shaped\nrotor having twelve proton-binding sites. This model is closely related to the\nmembrane-embedded F$_0$ motor of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase, which\nconverts the energy of the transmembrane electrochemical gradient of protons\ninto mechanical motion of the rotor. It is shown that the Coulomb coupling\nbetween the negative charge of the empty rotor site and the positive stator\ncharge, located near the periplasmic proton-conducting channel (proton source),\nplays a dominant role in the torque-generating process. When approaching the\nsource outlet, the rotor site has a proton energy level higher than the energy\nlevel of the site, located near the cytoplasmic channel (proton drain). In the\nfirst stage of this torque-generating process, the energy of the\nelectrochemical potential is converted into potential energy of the\nproton-binding sites on the rotor. Afterwards, the tangential component of the\nCoulomb force produces a mechanical torque. We demonstrate that, at low\ntemperatures, the loaded motor works in the shuttling regime where the energy\nof the electrochemical potential is consumed without producing any\nunidirectional rotation. The motor switches to the torque-generating regime at\nhigh temperatures, when the Brownian ratchet mechanism turns on. In the\npresence of a significant external torque, created by ATP hydrolysis, the\nsystem operates as a proton pump, which translocates protons against the\ntransmembrane potential gradient. Here we focus on the F$_0$ motor, even though\nour analysis is applicable to the bacterial flagellar motor.\n",

To distinguish this structural robustness from the abstract\norganizational robustness of systems, we call it anapedesis, and define it as\nthe scale-independent property of biological objects, from biomolecules to\norganisms, to deform and recover while minimizing and/or repairing the damage\nproduced by stretch. We propose to study the consequences of deformation of\nbiological objects closer to their structural and/or functional failure than\npreviously considered relevant. We show that structural robustness is present\nas a basic principle in many facets of biomedicine: many pathological\nconditions may derive from the failure of molecules, cells and their\nhigher-order assemblies to maintain robustness against deformation.\nFurthermore, structural robustness could have been the key selective criterion\nduring pre-biotic evolution and afterwards, and its universality can be\ndemonstrated by modeling using genetic algorithms. Thus, the specific\ninvestigation of bio-structural robustness as anapedesis could help the solving\nof fundamental problems of biology and medicine.\n",

        "abstract": "  Here we develop an approach to bio-structural robustness integrated with\nstructure-function relationship in a unified conceptual and methodological\nframework, and envision its study using adequate computational and experimental\nmethods. To distinguish this structural robustness from the abstract\norganizational robustness of systems, we call it anapedesis, and define it as\nthe scale-independent property of biological objects, from biomolecules to\norganisms, to deform and recover while minimizing and/or repairing the damage\nproduced by stretch. We propose to study the consequences of deformation of\nbiological objects closer to their structural and/or functional failure than\npreviously considered relevant. We show that structural robustness is present\nas a basic principle in many facets of biomedicine: many pathological\nconditions may derive from the failure of molecules, cells and their\nhigher-order assemblies to maintain robustness against deformation.\nFurthermore, structural robustness could have been the key selective criterion\nduring pre-biotic evolution and afterwards, and its universality can be\ndemonstrated by modeling using genetic algorithms. Thus, the specific\ninvestigation of bio-structural robustness as anapedesis could help the solving\nof fundamental problems of biology and medicine.\n",

        "abstract": "  This paper extends our recently developed Life Space Foam (LSF) model of\nmotivated cognitive dynamics \\cite{IA}. LSF uses adaptive path integrals to\ngenerate Lewinian force--fields on smooth manifolds, in order to characterize\nthe dynamics of individual goal--directed action. According to explanatory\ntheories growing in acceptance in cognitive neuroscience, one of the key\nproperties of this dynamics, capable of linking it to microscopic-level\ncortical neurodynamics, is its meta-stability and the resulting phase\ntransitions. Our extended LSF model incorporates the notion of phase\ntransitions and complements it with embedded geometrical chaos. To describe\nthis LSF phase transition, a general path--integral is used, along the\ncorresponding LSF topology change. As a result, our extended LSF model is able\nto rigorously represent co-action by two or more actors in the common\nLSF--manifold. The model yields substantial qualitative differences in\ngeometrical properties between bilateral and multi-lateral co-action due to\nintrinsic chaotic coupling between $n$ actors when $n\\geq 3$.\n  Keywords: cognitive dynamics, adaptive path integrals, phase transitions,\nchaos, topology change, human joint action, function approximation\n",

        "abstract": "  DNA synthesis in \\textit{Xenopus} frog embryos initiates stochastically in\ntime at many sites (origins) along the chromosome. Stochastic initiation\nimplies fluctuations in the time to complete and may lead to cell death if\nreplication takes longer than the cell cycle time ($\\approx 25$ min).\nSurprisingly, although the typical replication time is about 20 min, \\textit{in\nvivo} experiments show that replication fails to complete only about 1 in 300\ntimes. How is replication timing accurately controlled despite the\nstochasticity? Biologists have proposed two solutions to this\n\"random-completion problem.\" The first solution uses randomly located origins\nbut increases their rate of initiation as S phase proceeds, while the second\nuses regularly spaced origins. In this paper, we investigate the\nrandom-completion problem using a type of model first developed to describe the\nkinetics of first-order phase transitions. Using methods from the field of\nextreme-value statistics, we derive the distribution of replication-completion\ntimes for a finite genome. We then argue that the biologists' first solution to\nthe problem is not only consistent with experiment but also nearly optimizes\nthe use of replicative proteins. We also show that spatial regularity in origin\nplacement does not alter significantly the distribution of replication times\nand, thus, is not needed for the control of replication timing.\n",

The respiratory chain consists of four\nmetalloprotein Complexes (I-IV) embedded in the inner membrane of a\nmitochondrion. Three of these complexes pump protons across the membrane,\nfuelled by the energy of food-stuff electrons. Despite extensive biochemical\nand biophysical studies, the physical mechanism of this proton pumping is still\nnot well understood. Here we present a nanoelectromechanical model of the\nelectron-driven proton pump related to the second loop of the respiratory\nchain, where a lipid-soluble ubiquinone molecule shuttles between the Complex I\nand Complex III, carrying two electrons and two protons. We show that the\nenergy of electrons can be converted to the transmembrane proton potential\ngradient via the electrostatic interaction between electrons and protons on the\nshuttle. We find that the system can operate either as a proton pump, or, in\nthe reverse regime, as an electron pump. For membranes with various\nviscosities, we demonstrate that the uphill proton current peaks near the body\ntemperature $T \\approx 37 ^{\\circ}$C.\n",

        "abstract": "  Recent in vitro experiments have shown that DNA ejection from bacteriophage\ncan be partially stopped by surrounding osmotic pressure when ejected DNA is\ndigested by DNase I on the course of ejection. We argue in this work by\ncombination of experimental techniques (osmotic suppression without DNaseI\nmonitored by UV absorbance, pulse-field electrophoresis, and cryo-EM\nvisualization) and simple scaling modeling that intact genome (i.e. undigested)\nejection in a crowded environment is, on the contrary, enhanced or eventually\ncomplete with the help of a pulling force resulting from DNA condensation\ninduced by the osmotic stress itself. This demonstrates that in vivo, the\nosmotically stressed cell cytoplasm will promote phage DNA ejection rather than\nresisting it. The further addition of DNA-binding proteins under crowding\nconditions is shown to enhance the extent of ejection. We also found some\noptimal crowding conditions for which DNA content remaining in the capsid upon\nejection is maximum, which correlates well with the optimal conditions of\nmaximum DNA packaging efficiency into viral capsids observed almost 20 years\nago. Biological consequences of this finding are discussed.\n",

        "abstract": "  In advancing discrete-based computational cancer models towards clinical\napplications, one faces the dilemma of how to deal with an ever growing amount\nof biomedical data that ought to be incorporated eventually in one form or\nanother. Model scalability becomes of paramount interest. In an effort to start\naddressing this critical issue, here, we present a novel multi-scale and\nmulti-resolution agent-based in silico glioma model. While \"multi-scale\" refers\nto employing an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-driven molecular\nnetwork to process cellular phenotypic decisions within the micro-macroscopic\nenvironment, \"multi-resolution\" is achieved through algorithms that classify\ncells to either active or inactive spatial clusters, which determine the\nresolution they are simulated at. The aim is to assign computational resources\nwhere and when they matter most for maintaining or improving the predictive\npower of the algorithm, onto specific tumor areas and at particular times.\nUsing a previously described 2D brain tumor model, we have developed four\ndifferent computational methods for achieving the multi-resolution scheme,\nthree of which are designed to dynamically train on the high-resolution\nsimulation that serves as control. To quantify the algorithms' performance, we\nrank them by weighing the distinct computational time savings of the simulation\nruns versus the methods' ability to accurately reproduce the high-resolution\nresults of the control. Finally, to demonstrate the flexibility of the\nunderlying concept, we show the added value of combining the two highest-ranked\nmethods.\n",

A hybrid\nagent-based model has been developed to investigate the synergistic and\nantagonistic cell motility-impacting effects of three microenvironment\nvariables simultaneously: chemoattraction, haptotactic permission, and\nbiomechanical constraint or resistance. Reflecting distinct cell-specific\nintracellular machinery, the cancer cells are modelled as processing a variety\nof spatial search strategies that respond to these three influencing factors\nwith differential weights attached to each. While responding exclusively to\nchemoattraction optimizes cell displacement effectiveness, incorporating\npermission and resistance components becomes increasingly important with\ngreater distance to the chemoattractant source and/or after reducing the\nligand's effective diffusion coefficient. Extending this to a heterogeneous\npopulation of cells shows that displacement effectiveness increases with clonal\ndiversity as characterized by the Shannon index. However, the resulting data\ncan be fit best to an exponential function, suggesting that there is a level of\npopulation heterogeneity beyond which its added value to the cancer system\nbecomes minimal as directionality ceases to increase. Possible experimental\nextensions and potential clinical implications are discussed.\n",

Using micropatterned polydimethylsiloxane substrates\n(PDMS) with tuneable stiffness (500kPa, 750kPa, 2000kPa) and topography (lines,\npillars or unpatterned), we systematically analyse the differential response of\nnormal (3T3) and cancer (SaI/N) fibroblastic cells. Our results demonstrate\nthat both cells exhibit differential morphology and motility responses to\nchanges in substrate rigidiy and microtopography. 3T3 polarization and\nspreading are influenced by substrate microtopography and rigidity. The cells\nexhibit a persistent type of migration, which depends on the substrate\nanisotropy. In contrast, the dynamic of SaI/N spreading is strongly modified by\nthe substrate topography but not by substrate rigidity. SaI/N morphology and\nmigration seem to escape from extracellular cues: the cells exhibit\nuncorrelated migration trajectories and a large dispersion of their migration\nspeed, which increases with substrate rigidity.\n",

In this Comment,\nwithout questioning the existence of sub-diffusive behaviors, which certainly\nplay a key role in numbers of mechanisms in living systems, we point out that\nthe data used by J.M. Saxton can as well be fitted by a simple law, resulting\nfrom confined diffusion at short times, with a slower free diffusion\nsuperimposed at larger times. When visualizing MSD plots, the transition from\nshort-term diffusion confined in domains of size L, to slower, longer-term free\ndiffusion, can be confused with anomalous diffusion over several orders of\nmagnitude of time.\n",

One motor species always moves in one direction, e.g.\nconventional kinesin moves to the microtubule plus end, while cytoplasmic\ndynein moves to the microtubule minus end. However, many cellular cargos are\nobserved to move bidirectionally, involving both plus-end and minus-end\ndirected motors. The presumably simplest mechanism for such bidirectional\ntransport is provided by a tug-of-war between the two motor species. This\nmechanism is studied theoretically using the load-dependent transport\nproperties of individual motors as measured in single-molecule experiments. In\ncontrast to previous expectations, such a tug-of-war is found to be highly\ncooperative and to exhibit seven different motility regimes depending on the\nprecise values of the single motor parameters. The sensitivity of the transport\nprocess to small parameter changes can be used by the cell to regulate its\ncargo traffic.\n",

Scaffold proteins assemble multiple proteins in a spatially localized\nsignaling complex and exert numerous physical effects on signaling pathways. To\nstudy these effects, we consider a minimal, three-state kinetic model of\nscaffold mediated kinase activation. We first introduce and apply a path\nsummation technique to obtain approximate solutions to a single molecule master\nequation that governs protein kinase activation. We then consider exact\nnumerical solutions. We comment on when this approximation is appropriate and\nthen use this analysis to illustrate the competition of processes occurring at\nmany time scales involved in signal transduction in the presence of a scaffold\nprotein. The findings are consistent with recent experiments and simulation\ndata. Our results provide a framework and offer a mechanism for understanding\nhow scaffold proteins can influence the shape of the waiting time distribution\nof kinase activation and effectively broaden the times over which protein\nkinases are activated in the course of cell signaling.\n",

In order to investigate the regeneration ability of this crop, the\neffect of CdCl$_2$ on shoot regeneration (frequency of regeneration and bud\nnumber per tTCL) was examined. The tTCL explants were excised from cotyledon,\npetiole and hypocotyl of 7 day-old \\textit{B. juncea} seedlings and cultivated\non a solid basal MS medium supplemented with $\\alpha $-naphtalenacetic acid\n(NAA : 3.22 $\\mu$M), 6-benzylamino-purine (BAP : 26.6 $\\mu$M), sucrose (2 %,\nw/v), silver nitrate (AgNO3 : 10 $\\mu$M) and various concentrations of CdCl$_2$\n(0 - 250 $\\mu$M). A concentration of CdCl$_2$ of 5 $\\mu$M is enough to reduce\nsignificantly the percentage of regenerated tTCL from 95-100 % to 77-86 % for\nall organs tested. In addition, 5 $\\mu$M of CdCl$_2$ reduces the bud number\nfrom 4.5 to 2.98 and 3.2 to 2.02 of hypocotyl and petiole tTCLs, but not for\ncotyledon tTCLs. Besides, 250 $\\mu$M of CdCl$_2$ is lethal for all tTCLs\nwhatever the organ, and 200 $\\mu$M is lethal only for cotyledon and petiole\ntTCLs but not for hypocotyl explants which had 3.6 % of frequency of shoot\nregeneration. Plantlets regenerated from all shoots, whatever the treatment,\ndeveloped and flowered normally 6 weeks after the transfer to pots. The\nregenerated plants were fertile and identical to source plants.\n",

        "abstract": "  Neuroinflammation is one of the key pathological events involved in the\nprogression of brain damage caused by cerebral ischemia. Metabolism of\narachidonic acid through cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes is known to be actively\ninvolved in the neuroinflammatory events leading to neuronal death after\nischemia. Two isoforms of COX, termed COX-1 and COX-2, have been identified.\nUnlike COX-1, COX-2 expression is dramatically induced by ischemia and appears\nto be an effector of tissue damage. This review article will focus specifically\non the involvement of COX isozymes in brain ischemia. We will discuss issues\nrelated to the biochemistry and selective pharmacological inhibition of COX\nenzymes, and further refer to their expression in the brain under normal\nconditions and following excitotoxicity and ischemic cerebral injury. We will\nreview present knowledge of the relative contribution of each COX isoform to\nthe brain ischemic pathology, based on data from investigations utilizing\nselective COX-1/COX-2 inhibitors and genetic knockout mouse models. The\nmechanisms of neurotoxicity associated with increased COX activity after\nischemia will also be examined. Finally, we will provide a critical evaluation\nof the therapeutic potential of COX inhibitors in cerebral ischemia and discuss\nnew targets downstream of COX with potential neuroprotective ability.\n",

        "abstract": "  The tolerance of bacterial populations to biocidal or antibiotic treatment\nhas been well documented in both biofilm and planktonic settings. However,\nthere is still very little known about the mechanisms that produce this\ntolerance. Evidence that small, non-mutant subpopulations of bacteria are not\naffected by antibiotic challenge has been accumulating and provides an\nattractive explanation for the failure of typical dosing protocols. Although a\ndosing challenge can kill all the susceptible bacteria, the remaining persister\ncells can serve as a source of population regrowth. We give a robust condition\nfor the failure of a periodic dosing protocol for a general chemostat model,\nwhich supports the mathematical conclusions and simulations of an earlier, more\nspecialized batch model. Our condition implies that the treatment protocol\nfails globally, in the sense that a mixed bacterial population will ultimately\npersist above a level that is independent of the initial composition of the\npopulation. We also give a sufficient condition for treatment success, at least\nfor initial population compositions near the steady state of interest,\ncorresponding to bacterial washout. Finally, we investigate how the speed at\nwhich the bacteria are wiped out depends on the duration of administration of\nthe antibiotic. We find that this dependence is not necessarily monotone,\nimplying that optimal dosing does not necessarily correspond to continuous\nadministration of the antibiotic. Thus, genuine periodic protocols can be more\nadvantageous in treating a wide variety of bacterial infections.\n",

M. Zorzenon dos Santos and S. Coutinho,\nPhys. Rev. Lett. 87, 168102 (2001)]. The analysis focussed on the dynamic\nbehavior of the model when defined in lattices with different symmetries and\ndimensionalities. The results illustrated that the three-phase dynamics of the\nplanar models suffered minor changes in relation to lattice symmetry variations\nand, while differences were observed regarding dimensionality changes,\nqualitative behavior was preserved. A further investigation was conducted into\nprimary infection and sensitiveness of the latency period to variations of the\nmodel's stochastic parameters over wide ranging values. The variables\ncharacterizing primary infection and the latency period exhibited power-law\nbehavior when the stochastic parameters varied over a few orders of magnitude.\nThe power-law exponents were approximately the same when lattice symmetry\nvaried, but there was a significant variation when dimensionality changed from\ntwo to three. The dynamics of the three-dimensional model was also shown to be\ninsensitive to variations of the deterministic parameters related to cell\nresistance to the infection, and the necessary time lag to mount the specific\nimmune response to HIV variants. The robustness of the model demonstrated in\nthis work reinforce that its basic hypothesis are consistent with the\nthree-stage dynamic of the HIV infection observed in patients.\n",

        "abstract": "  The origin of diversification and coexistence of genes and species have been\ntraditionally studied in isolated biological levels. Ecological and\nevolutionary views have focused on the mechanisms that enable or constrain\nspecies coexistence, genetic variation and the genetics of speciation, but a\nunified theory linking those approaches is still missing. Here we introduce\nevolutionary graphs in the context of neutral theories of molecular evolution\nand biodiversity to provide a framework that simultaneously addresses\nspeciation rate and joint genetic and species diversities. To illuminate this\nquestion we also study two models of evolution on graphs with fitness\ndifferences, which provide insights on how genetic and ecological dynamics\ndrive the speed of diversification. Neutral evolution generates the highest\nspeed of speciation, species richness (i.e. five times and twice as many\nspecies as compared to genetic and ecological graphs, respectively) and\ngenetic--species diversity (i.e., twice as many as genetic and ecological\ngraphs, respectively). Thus the speed of speciation, the genetic--species\ndiversity and coexistence can differ dramatically depending on whether genetic\nfactors versus ecological factors drive the evolution of the system. By linking\nmolecular, sexual and trophic behavior at ecological and evolutionary scales,\ninteracting graphs can illuminate the origin and evolution of diversity and\norganismal coexistence.\n",

We hypothesize that the\nmutation affects the strength of cell-cell adhesion. We investigate this effect\nin a new experiment, which follows the clustering dynamics of glioma cells on a\nsurface. We interpret our results in terms of a stochastic model and identify\ntwo mechanisms of clustering. First, there is a critical value of the strength\nof adhesion; above the threshold, large clusters grow from a homogeneous\nsuspension of cells; below it, the system remains homogeneous, similarly to the\nordinary phase separation. Second, when cells form a cluster, we have evidence\nthat they increase their proliferation rate. We have successfully reproduced\nthe experimental findings and found that both mechanisms are crucial for\ncluster formation and growth.\n",

Striped patterns of gene expression that lead to the\nfuture body segments appear simultaneously or sequentially in long and short\ngerm-band development, respectively. Regulatory genes relevant for stripe\nformation are evolutionarily conserved among arthropods, therefore the\ndifferences in the observed traits are thought to have originated from how the\ngenes are wired. To reveal the basic differences in the network structure, we\nhave numerically evolved hundreds of gene regulatory networks that produce\nstriped patterns of gene expression. By analyzing the topologies of the\ngenerated networks, we show that the characteristics of stripe formation in\nlong and short germ-band development are determined by Feed-Forward Loops\n(FFLs) and negative Feed-Back Loops (FBLs) respectively. Network architectures,\ngene expression patterns and knockout responses exhibited by the artificially\nevolved networks agree with those reported in the fly Drosophila melanogaster\nand the beetle Tribolium castaneum. For other arthropod species, principal\nnetwork architectures that remain largely unknown are predicted.\n",

These \"autonomous\noscillations\" have often appeared with periods that are nearly integer divisors\nof the calculated doubling time of the culture.\n  We hypothesize that these oscillations could be caused by a weak form of cell\ncycle synchronization that we call clustering. We develop some novel ordinary\ndifferential equation models of the cell cycle. For these models, and for\nrandom and stochastic perturbations, we give both rigorous proofs and\nsimulations showing that both positive and negative growth rate feedback within\nthe cell cycle are possible agents that can cause clustering of populations\nwithin the cell cycle. It occurs for a variety of models and for a broad\nselection of parameter values. These results suggest that the clustering\nphenomenon is robust and is likely to be observed in nature. Since there are\nnecessarily an integer number of clusters, clustering would lead to\nperiodic-like behavior with periods that are nearly integer divisors of the\nperiod of the cell cycle.\n",

The gene product LamB is an important membrane protein for maltose\ntransport into cells but it is also exploited by bacteriophage lambda for\ninfection. Although our bacterial population is clonal, stochastic gene\nexpression leads to a majority population with a large receptor number and a\nminority population with a small receptor number.

        "abstract": "  The production of peroxide and superoxide is an inevitable consequence of\naerobic metabolism, and while these particular \"reactive oxygen species\" (ROSs)\ncan exhibit a number of biological effects, they are not of themselves\nexcessively reactive and thus they are not especially damaging at physiological\nconcentrations. However, their reactions with poorly liganded iron species can\nlead to the catalytic production of the very reactive and dangerous hydroxyl\nradical, which is exceptionally damaging, and a major cause of chronic\ninflammation. We review the considerable and wide-ranging evidence for the\ninvolvement of this combination of (su)peroxide and poorly liganded iron in a\nlarge number of physiological and indeed pathological processes and\ninflammatory disorders, especially those involving the progressive degradation\nof cellular and organismal performance. These diseases share a great many\nsimilarities and thus might be considered to have a common cause (i.e.\niron-catalysed free radical and especially hydroxyl radical generation). The\nstudies reviewed include those focused on a series of cardiovascular, metabolic\nand neurological diseases, where iron can be found at the sites of plaques and\nlesions, as well as studies showing the significance of iron to aging and\nlongevity. The effective chelation of iron by natural or synthetic ligands is\nthus of major physiological (and potentially therapeutic) importance. As\nsystems properties, we need to recognise that physiological observables have\nmultiple molecular causes, and studying them in isolation leads to inconsistent\npatterns of apparent causality when it is the simultaneous combination of\nmultiple factors that is responsible. This explains, for instance, the\ndecidedly mixed effects of antioxidants that have been observed, etc...\n",

Since the former can be regarded as the basis to realize\nthe latter, playing essential roles in various cellular functions, it is\nimportant to investigate spontaneous movement quantitatively at different\nphysiological conditions in relation to cellular physiological functions. For\nthat purpose, we observed a series of spontaneous movements by Dictyostelium\ncells at different developmental periods by using a single cell tracking\nsystem. Using statistical analysis of these traced data, we found that cells\nshowed complex dynamics with anomalous diffusion and that their velocity\ndistribution had power-law tails in all conditions. Furthermore, as development\nproceeded, average velocity and persistency of the movement increased and as\ntoo did the exponential behavior in the velocity distribution. Based on these\nresults, we succeeded in applying a generalized Langevin model to the\nexperimental data. With this model, we discuss the relation of spontaneous cell\nmovement to cellular physiological function and its relevance to behavioral\nstrategies for cell survival.\n",

Based on\nthe analysis of C-value paradox and the evolution of genome size we propose\nthat the function-coding information quantity of a genome always grows in the\ncourse of evolution through sequence duplication, expansion of code, and gene\ntransfer from outside. The function-coding information quantity of a genome\nconsists of two parts, p-coding information quantity which encodes functional\nprotein and n-coding information quantity which encodes other functional\nelements except amino acid sequence. The evidences on the evolutionary law\nabout the function-coding information quantity are listed. The needs of\nfunction is the motive force for the expansion of coding information quantity\nand the information quantity expansion is the way to make functional innovation\nand extension for a species. So, the increase of coding information quantity of\na genome is a measure of the acquired new function and it determines the\ndirectionality of genome evolution.\n",

Moreover, the system is subjected to an\nexternal additive noise which mimics the influence of the environment of the\ntumor. The stationary probability distribution Ps is derived depending on the\nfinite correlation time, the immunization rate and the strength of the\ncrosscorrelation. Ps offers a maximum which becomes more pronounced for\nincreasing immunization rate. The mean-first passage time is also calculated in\norder to find out under which conditions the tumor can suffer extinction. Its\ncharacteristics is again controlled by the degree of immunization and the\nstrength of the cross-correlation. The behavior observed can be interpreted in\nterms of the three state model of a tumor population.\n",

        "abstract": "  Spatially explicit models have been widely used in today's mathematical\necology and epidemiology to study persistence and extinction of populations as\nwell as their spatial patterns. Here we extend the earlier work--static\ndispersal between neighbouring individuals to mobility of individuals as well\nas multi-patches environment. As is commonly found, the basic reproductive\nratio is maximized for the evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) on diseases'\npersistence in mean-field theory. This has important implications, as it\nimplies that for a wide range of parameters that infection rate will tend\nmaximum. This is opposite with present results obtained in spatial explicit\nmodels that infection rate is limited by upper bound. We observe the emergence\nof trade-offs of extinction and persistence on the parameters of the infection\nperiod and infection rate and show the extinction time having a linear\nrelationship with respect to system size. We further find that the higher\nmobility can pronouncedly promote the persistence of spread of epidemics, i.e.,\nthe phase transition occurs from extinction domain to persistence domain, and\nthe spirals' wavelength increases as the mobility increasing and ultimately, it\nwill saturate at a certain value. Furthermore, for multi-patches case, we find\nthat the lower coupling strength leads to anti-phase oscillation of infected\nfraction, while higher coupling strength corresponds to in-phase oscillation.\n",

Here we show that\nsuch behavior can be mapped into the response of a simple electronic circuit\nconsisting of an $LC$ contour and a memory-resistor (a memristor) to a train of\nvoltage pulses that mimic environment changes. We also identify a possible\nbiological origin of the memristive behavior in the cell. These biological\nmemory features are likely to occur in other unicellular as well as\nmulticellular organisms, albeit in different forms. Therefore, the above\nmemristive circuit model, which has learning properties, is useful to better\nunderstand the origins of primitive intelligence.\n",

Approximating\nthe dynamics of continuous variables by discrete values and Boolean logic gates\nmay, however, introduce dynamical possibilities that are not accessible to the\noriginal system. We show that large random networks of variables coupled\nthrough continuous transfer functions often fail to exhibit the complex\ndynamics of corresponding Boolean models in the disordered (chaotic) regime,\neven when each individual function appears to be a good candidate for Boolean\nidealization. A suitably modified Boolean theory explains the behavior of\nsystems in which information does not propagate faithfully down certain chains\nof nodes. Model networks incorporating calculated or directly measured transfer\nfunctions reported in the literature on transcriptional regulation of genes are\ndescribed by the modified theory.\n",

While these models are, at best, caricatures of peptides, we\nshow that a number of generic features thought to govern fibril assembly are\npresent in the toy model. The monomer, which contains eight beads made from\nthree letters (hydrophobic, polar, and charged), adopts a compact conformation\nin the native state. The kinetics of fibril assembly occurs in three distinct\nstages. In each stage there is a cascade of events that transforms the monomers\nand oligomers to ordered structures. In the first \"burst\" stage highly mobile\noligomers of varying sizes form. The conversion to the aggregation-prone\nconformation occurs within the oligomers during the second stage. As time\nprogresses, a dominant cluster emerges that contains a majority of the chains.\nIn the final stage, the aggregation-prone conformation particles serve as a\ntemplate onto which smaller oligomers or monomers can dock and undergo\nconversion to fibril structures. The overall time for growth in the latter\nstages is well described by the Lifshitz-Slyazov growth kinetics for\ncrystallization from super-saturated solutions.\n",

        "abstract": "  Gliding saves much energy, and to make large distances using only this form\nof flight represents a great challenge for both birds and people. The solution\nis to make use of the so-called thermals, which are localized, warmer regions\nin the atmosphere moving upwards with a speed exceeding the descent rate of\nbird and plane. Whereas birds use this technique mainly for foraging, humans do\nit as a sporting activity. Thermalling involves efficient optimization\nincluding the skilful localization of thermals, trying to guess the most\nfavorable route, estimating the best descending rate, etc. In this study, we\naddress the question whether there are any analogies between the solutions\nbirds and humans find to handle the above task. High-resolution track logs were\ntaken from thermalling falcons and paraglider pilots to determine the essential\nparameters of the flight patterns. We find that there are relevant common\nfeatures in the ways birds and humans use thermals. In particular, falcons seem\nto reproduce the MacCready formula widely used by gliders to calculate the best\nslope to take before an upcoming thermal.\n",

        "abstract": "  Color centers in diamond nanocrystals are a new class of fluorescence markers\nthat attract significant interest due to matchless brightness, photostability\nand biochemical inertness. Fluorescing diamond nanocrystals containing defects\ncan be used as markers replacing conventional organic dye molecules, quantum\ndots or autofluorescent proteins. They can be applied for tracking and\nultrahigh-resolution localization of the single markers. In addition the spin\nproperties of diamond defects can be utilized for novel magneto-optical imaging\n(MOI) with nanometer resolution. We develop this technique to unravel the\ndetails of the rotary motions and the elastic energy storage mechanism of a\nsingle biological nanomotor FoF1-ATP synthase. FoF1-ATP synthase is the enzyme\nthat provides the 'chemical energy currency' adenosine triphosphate, ATP, for\nliving cells. The formation of ATP is accomplished by a stepwise internal\nrotation of subunits within the enzyme. Previously subunit rotation has been\nmonitored by single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and\nwas limited by the photostability of the fluorophores. Fluorescent nanodiamonds\nadvance these FRET measurements to long time scales.\n",

While some patterns\nemerge from these attempts to represent biological complexity, a single measure\nto encompass the seemingly countless features of biological systems, still\neludes the students of Biology. It is the pursuit of this paper to discuss the\nfeasibility of finding one complete and objective measure for biological\ncomplexity. A theoretical construct (the 'Thread-Mesh model') is proposed here\nto describe biological reality. It segments the entire biological space-time in\na series of different biological organizations before modeling the property\nspace of each of these organizations with computational and topological\nconstructs. Acknowledging emergence as a key biological property, it has been\nproved here that the quest for an objective and all-encompassing biological\ncomplexity measure would necessarily end up in failure. Since any study of\nbiological complexity is rooted in the knowledge of biological reality, an\nexpression for possible limit of human knowledge about ontological biological\nreality, in the form of an uncertainty principle, is proposed here. Two\ntheorems are proposed to model the fundamental limitation, owing to observer\ndependent nature of description of biological reality. They explain the reasons\nbehind failures to construct a single and complete biological complexity\nmeasure. This model finds support in various experimental results and therefore\nprovides a reliable and general way to study biological complexity and\nbiological reality.\n",

While there have been few previous attempts to (implicitly)\nmodel various facets of biological context-dependence, a formal and general\nmathematical construct to model the wide spectrum of context-dependence, eludes\nthe students of biology. An objective and rigorous model, from both 'bottom-up'\nas well as 'top-down' perspective, is proposed here to serve as the template to\ndescribe the various kinds of context-dependence that we encounter in different\nbranches of biology. Interactions between biological contexts was found to be\ntransitive but non-commutative. It is found that a hierarchical nature of\ndependence amongst the biological contexts models the emergent biological\nproperties efficiently. Reasons for these findings are provided with a general\nmodel to describe biological reality. Scheme to algorithmically implement the\nhierarchic structure of organization of biological contexts was achieved with a\nconstruct named 'Context tree'. A 'Context tree' based analysis of context\ninteractions among biophysical factors influencing protein structure was\nperformed.\n",

The age of the\nmost developed insect larvae (mostly blow fly larvae) gives reasonably reliable\ninformation about the minimum time a person has been dead. Methods such as\nisomegalen diagrams or ADH calculations can have problems in their reliability,\nso we established in this study a new growth model to calculate the larval age\nof \\textit{Lucilia sericata} (Meigen 1826). This is based on the actual\nnon-linear development of the blow fly and is designed to include\nuncertainties, e.g. for temperature values from the crime scene. We used\npublished data for the development of \\textit{L. sericata} to estimate\nnon-linear functions describing the temperature dependent behavior of each\ndevelopmental state. For the new model it is most important to determine the\nprogress within one developmental state as correctly as possible since this\naffects the accuracy of the PMI estimation by up to 75%. We found that PMI\ncalculations based on one mean temperature value differ by up to 65% from PMIs\nbased on an 12-hourly time temperature profile. Differences of 2\\degree C in\nthe estimation of the crime scene temperature result in a deviation in PMI\ncalculation of 15 - 30%.\n",

        "abstract": "  Litter decomposition is an important process in the global carbon cycle. It\naccounts for most of the heterotrophic soil respiration and results in\nformation of more stable soil organic carbon (SOC) which is the largest\nterrestrial carbon stock. Litter decomposition may induce remarkable feedbacks\nto climate change because it is a climate-dependent process. To investigate the\nglobal patterns of litter decomposition, we developed a description of this\nprocess and tested the validity of this description using a large set of foliar\nlitter mass loss measurements (nearly 10 000 data points derived from\napproximately 70 000 litter bags). We applied the Markov chain Monte Carlo\nmethod to estimate uncertainty in the parameter values and results of our model\ncalled Yasso07. The model appeared globally applicable. It estimated the\neffects of litter type (plant species) and climate on mass loss with little\nsystematic error over the first 10 decomposition years, using only initial\nlitter chemistry, air temperature and precipitation as input variables.\nIllustrative of the global variability in litter mass loss rates, our example\ncalculations showed that a typical conifer litter had 68% of its initial mass\nstill remaining after two decomposition years in tundra while a deciduous\nlitter had only 15% remaining in the tropics. Uncertainty in these estimates, a\ndirect result of the uncertainty of the parameter values of the model, varied\naccording to the distribution of the litter bag data among climate conditions\nand ranged from 2% in tundra to 4% in the tropics. This reliability was\nadequate to use the model and distinguish the effects of even small differences\nin litter quality or climate conditions on litter decomposition as\nstatistically significant.\n",

        "abstract": "  In this paper, we analyze the temporal evolution of the age-dependent force\nof infection and incidence of rubella, after the introduction of a very\nspecific vaccination programme in a previously nonvaccinated population where\nrubella was in endemic steady state. We deduce an integral equation for the\nage-dependent force of infection, which depends on a number of parameters that\ncan be estimated from the force of infection in steady state prior to the\nvaccination program. We present the results of our simulations, which are\ncompared with observed data. We also examine the influence of contact patterns\namong members of a community on the age-dependent intensity of transmission of\nrubella and on the results of vaccination strategies. As an example of the\ntheory proposed, we calculate the effects of vaccination strategies for four\ncommunities from Caieiras (Brazil), Huixquilucan (Mexico), Finland and the\nUnited Kingdom. The results for each community differ considerably according to\nthe distinct intensity and pattern of transmission in the absence of\nvaccination. We conclude that this simple vaccination program is not very\nefficient (very slow) in the goal of eradicating the disease. This gives\nsupport to a mixed strategy, proposed by Massad et al., accepted and\nimplemented by the government of the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n",

        "abstract": "  We study the mechanics of a reversible decohesion (unzipping) of an elastic\nlayer subjected to quasi-static end-point loading. At the micro level the\nsystem is simulated by an elastic chain of particles interacting with a rigid\nfoundation through breakable springs. Such system can be viewed as prototypical\nfor the description of a wide range of phenomena from peeling of polymeric\ntapes, to rolling of cells, working of gecko's fibrillar structures and\ndenaturation of DNA. We construct a rigorous continuum limit of the discrete\nmodel which captures both stable and metastable configurations and present a\ndetailed parametric study of the interplay between elastic and cohesive\ninteractions. We show that the model reproduces the experimentally observed\nabrupt transition from an incremental evolution of the adhesion front to a\nsudden complete decohesion of a macroscopic segment of the adhesion layer. As\nthe microscopic parameters vary the macroscopic response changes from\nquasi-ductile to quasi-brittle, with corresponding decrease in the size of the\nadhesion hysteresis. At the micro-scale this corresponds to a transition from a\n`localized' to a `diffuse' structure of the decohesion front (domain wall). We\nobtain an explicit expression for the critical debonding threshold in the limit\nwhen the internal length scales are much smaller than the size of the system.\nThe achieved parametric control of the microscopic mechanism can be used in the\ndesign of new biological inspired adhesion devices and machines.\n",

Invasion into the hospital setting with replacement of the\nhospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) has also been documented. Co-colonization with\nboth CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA would have important clinical implications given\ndifferences in antimicrobial susceptibility profiles and the potential for\nexchange of genetic information.\n  Methods: A deterministic mathematical model was developed to characterize the\ntransmission dynamics of HA-MRSA and CA-MRSA in the hospital setting and to\nquantify the emergence of co-colonization with both strains.\n  Results: The model analysis shows that the state of co-colonization becomes\nendemic over time and that there is no competitive exclusion of either strain.\nIncreasing the length of stay or rate of hospital entry among patients\ncolonized with CA-MRSA leads to a rapid increase in the co-colonized state.\nCompared to MRSA decolonization strategy, improving hand hygiene compliance has\nthe greatest impact on decreasing the prevalence of HA-MRSA, CA-MRSA and the\nco-colonized state.\n  Conclusions: The model predicts that with the expanding community reservoir\nof CA-MRSA, the majority of hospitalized patients will become colonized with\nboth CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA.\n",
