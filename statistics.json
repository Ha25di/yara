In the linear regime it was found that\nthe confinement decreases the amplitude of dynamic magnetization near the\nlateral stripe edges. Thus, the so-called effective dipolar pinning of dynamic\nmagnetization takes place at the edges.\n  In the nonlinear regime a new stable spin wave packet propagating along a\nwaveguide structure, for which both transversal instability and interaction\nwith the side walls of the waveguide are important was observed. The\nexperiments and a numerical simulation of the pulse evolution show that the\nshape of the formed waveforms and their behavior are strongly influenced by the\nconfinement.\n",

        "abstract": "  We present a theoretical framework for plasma turbulence in astrophysical\nplasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks).\nThe key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the\nmean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron\nfrequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted\ninto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC\nCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and\nvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of\nthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically\nreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above the\nion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic\nfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional\nand collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,\nwhich obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated\nwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and\nelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave\n(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive\nphase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the\nenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless\nwave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the\nphase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the\nelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling\nrelations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical\napplications are discussed in detail.\n",

We consider\nlarge-scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can be\nneglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas dynamics with an\nadditional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We\nemploy Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary\nanalytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These\nsolutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in\na finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups\nsignal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up\ntime $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\\sim\n(t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while\nthe velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock\ndiscontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the\nsingularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas\npressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time\nclose to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density\nblowup, of the same type, may coexist with an \"ordinary\" shock, at which the\nhydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the\nexact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving\nthe ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. Furthermore, numerical solutions\nshow that the local features of the density blowup hold universally,\nindependently of details of the initial and boundary conditions.\n",

At the\npumping level growth, the clearly depined increasing of the number of\ncoexisting SE states has been observed both in real physical experiments and in\ncomputer simulations. This confirms the analytical estimations of the branching\ndensity in the phase space. The nature of the refractority of SE pulses is\nclosely connected with the pointed branching and reflects the crises of strange\nattractors, i.e. their collisions with unstable periodic components of the\nhigher branches of SE states in the nonautonomous microwave phonon laser.\n",

        "abstract": "  For the past two decades, single-index model, a special case of projection\npursuit regression, has proven to be an efficient way of coping with the high\ndimensional problem in nonparametric regression. In this paper, based on weakly\ndependent sample, we investigate the single-index prediction (SIP) model which\nis robust against deviation from the single-index model. The single-index is\nidentified by the best approximation to the multivariate prediction function of\nthe response variable, regardless of whether the prediction function is a\ngenuine single-index function. A polynomial spline estimator is proposed for\nthe single-index prediction coefficients, and is shown to be root-n consistent\nand asymptotically normal. An iterative optimization routine is used which is\nsufficiently fast for the user to analyze large data of high dimension within\nseconds. Simulation experiments have provided strong evidence that corroborates\nwith the asymptotic theory. Application of the proposed procedure to the rive\nflow data of Iceland has yielded superior out-of-sample rolling forecasts.\n",

Then generalized entropies are introduced, all\nof which give generalizations to Shannon entropy. It is shown that the nature\nof the recursivity postulate automatically determines the logarithmic\nfunctional form for Shannon entropy. Due to the logarithmic nature, Shannon\nentropy naturally gives rise to additivity, when applied to situations having\nproduct probability property. It is argued that the natural process is\nnon-additivity, important, for example, in statistical mechanics, even in\nproduct probability property situations and additivity can hold due to the\ninvolvement of a recursivity postulate leading to a logarithmic function.\nGeneralizations, including Mathai's generalized entropy are introduced and some\nof the properties are examined. Situations are examined where Mathai's entropy\nleads to pathway models, exponential and power law behavior and related\ndifferential equations. Connection of Mathai's entropy to Kerridge's measure of\n\"inaccuracy\" is also explored.\n",

The solution is derived by the application of the Laplace and\nFourier transforms in closed form in terms of the H-function. The results\nderived are of general nature and include the results investigated earlier by\nmany authors, notably by Mainardi et al. (2001, 2005) for the fundamental\nsolution of the space-time fractional diffusion equation, and Saxena et al.\n(2006a, b) for fractional reaction- diffusion equations. The advantage of using\nRiesz-Feller derivative lies in the fact that the solution of the fractional\nreaction-diffusion equation containing this derivative includes the fundamental\nsolution for space-time fractional diffusion, which itself is a generalization\nof neutral fractional diffusion, space-fractional diffusion, and\ntime-fractional diffusion. These specialized types of diffusion can be\ninterpreted as spatial probability density functions evolving in time and are\nexpressible in terms of the H-functions in compact form.\n",

This paper introduces a novel approach for the\nassessment of such chronic food risk that integrates the pharmacokinetic\nproperties of a given contaminant. The estimation of such a Kinetic Dietary\nExposure Model (KDEM) should be based on long term consumption data which, for\nthe moment, can only be provided by Household Budget Surveys such as the\nSECODIP panel in France. A semi parametric model is proposed to decompose a\nseries of household quantities into individual quantities which are then used\nas inputs of the KDEM. As an illustration, the risk assessment related to the\npresence of methyl mercury in seafood is revisited using this novel approach.\n",

        "abstract": "  Pattern formation and evolution in unsynchronizable complex networks are\ninvestigated. Due to the asymmetric topology, the synchronous patterns formed\nin complex networks are irregular and nonstationary. For coupling strength\nimmediately out of the synchronizable region, the typical phenomenon is the\non-off intermittency of the system dynamics. The patterns appeared in this\nprocess are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprises\nmost of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters. The pattern evolution is\ncharacterized by the giant cluster irregularly absorbs or emits the small\nclusters. As the coupling strength leaves away from the synchronization\nbifurcation point, the giant cluster is gradually dissolved into a number of\nsmall clusters, and the system dynamics is characterized by the integration and\nseparation of the small clusters. Dynamical mechanisms and statistical\nproperties of the nonstationary pattern evolution are analyzed and conducted,\nand some scalings are newly revealed. Remarkably, it is found that the few\nactive nodes, which escape from the giant cluster with a high frequency, are\nindependent of the coupling strength while are sensitive to the bifurcation\ntypes. We hope our findings about nonstationary pattern could give additional\nunderstandings to the dynamics of complex systems and have implications to some\nreal problems where systems maintain their normal functions only in the\nunsynchronizable state.\n",

In both this examples the naive choice of\nproposal chain gives rise, for some parameters, to a slowly mixing Metropolis\nchain, that is a chain whose spectral gap decreases exponentially fast (in the\ndimension $N$ of the problem). Here we show how a slight variant in the\nproposal chain can avoid this problem, keeping the mean computational cost\nsimilar to the cost of the usual Metropolis. More precisely we prove that, with\na suitable variant in the proposal, the Metropolis chain has a spectral gap\nwhich decreases polynomially in 1/N. Using some symmetry structure of the\nenergy, the method rests on allowing appropriate jumps within the energy level\nof the starting state.\n",

        "abstract": "  Conditional independence models in the Gaussian case are algebraic varieties\nin the cone of positive definite covariance matrices. We study these varieties\nin the case of Bayesian networks, with a view towards generalizing the\nrecursive factorization theorem to situations with hidden variables. In the\ncase when the underlying graph is a tree, we show that the vanishing ideal of\nthe model is generated by the conditional independence statements implied by\ngraph. We also show that the ideal of any Bayesian network is homogeneous with\nrespect to a multigrading induced by a collection of upstream random variables.\nThis has a number of important consequences for hidden variable models.\nFinally, we relate the ideals of Bayesian networks to a number of classical\nconstructions in algebraic geometry including toric degenerations of the\nGrassmannian, matrix Schubert varieties, and secant varieties.\n",

Energies of nodes with different numbers of neighbors are supposed to\nbe positive. The dynamics is that of flipping the diagonal of two adjacent\ntriangles, with a temperature dependent probability. We show that this system\nhas an approach to a steady state which is exponentially slow, and show that\nthe stationary state is unordered. We also study the local energy landscape and\nshow that it has the hierarchical structure known from spin glasses. Finally,\nwe show that the evolution can be described as that of a rarefied gas with\nspontaneous generation of particles and annihilating collisions.\n",

In the\nsecond stage we select one model by cross-validation. In the third stage we use\nhypothesis testing to eliminate some variables. We refer to the first two\nstages as \"screening\" and the last stage as \"cleaning.\" We consider three\nscreening methods: the lasso, marginal regression, and forward stepwise\nregression. Our method gives consistent variable selection under certain\nconditions.\n",

It allows one to solve explicitly for the\nsynchronization order parameter and the critical point of 1) the full\nphase-locking transition for a system with a finite number of oscillators\n(unlike the original Kuramoto model, which is solvable implicitly only in the\nmean-field limit) and 2) a new class of continuum systems. It also makes it\npossible to probe the system's dynamics as it moves towards a steady state.\nWhile discussion in this paper is restricted to systems with global coupling,\nthe new formalism introduced by the linear reformulation also lends itself to\nsolving systems that exhibit local or asymmetric coupling.\n",

        "abstract": "  We present numerical studies for finitely extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE)\ndumbbells which are dispersed in a turbulent plane shear flow at moderate\nReynolds number. The polymer ensemble is described on the mesoscopic level by a\nset of stochastic ordinary differential equations with Brownian noise. The\ndynamics of the Newtonian solvent is determined by the Navier-Stokes equations.\nMomentum transfer of the dumbbells with the solvent is implemented by an\nadditional volume forcing term in the Navier-Stokes equations, such that both\ncomponents of the resulting viscoelastic fluid are connected by a two-way\ncoupling. The dynamics of the dumbbells is given then by Newton's second law of\nmotion including small inertia effects. We investigate the dynamics of the flow\nfor different degrees of dumbbell elasticity and inertia, as given by\nWeissenberg and Stokes numbers, respectively. For the parameters accessible in\nour study, the magnitude of the feedback of the polymers on the macroscopic\nproperties of turbulence remains small as quantified by the global energy\nbudget and the Reynolds stresses. A reduction of the turbulent drag by up to\n20% is observed for the larger particle inertia. The angular statistics of the\ndumbbells shows an increasing alignment with the mean flow direction for both,\nincreasing elasticity and inertia. This goes in line with a growing asymmetry\nof the probability density function of the transverse derivative of the\nstreamwise turbulent velocity component. We find that dumbbells get stretched\nreferentially in regions where vortex stretching or bi-axial strain dominate\nthe local dynamics and topology of the velocity gradient tensor.\n",

In particular for integer orders alpha some further series\nare provided, including a convex combination of gamma distributions for alpha =\n1 and nearly of this type for alpha > 1. Furthermore, some representations of\nthe distribution of the angle Phi between (X1,...,Xn) and (1,...,1) are given\nby orthogonal series. All these series are based on the same sequence of easily\ncomputed moments of cos(Phi).\n",

Such work was frequently motivated\nby new emerging applications of Burgers model to statistical physics,\ncosmology, and fluid dynamics. Also Burgers turbulence appeared as one of the\nsimplest instances of a nonlinear system out of equilibrium. The study of\nrandom Lagrangian systems, of stochastic partial differential equations and\ntheir invariant measures, the theory of dynamical systems, the applications of\nfield theory to the understanding of dissipative anomalies and of multiscaling\nin hydrodynamic turbulence have benefited significantly from progress in\nBurgers turbulence. The aim of this review is to give a unified view of\nselected work stemming from these rather diverse disciplines.\n",

This theory is consistent with\nprevious results. In the all-to-all case, the fluctuations in this theory are\ndue completely to finite size corrections, which can be calculated in an\nexpansion in 1/N, where N is the number of oscillators. The N -> infinity limit\nof this theory is what is traditionally called mean field theory for the\nKuramoto model.\n",

On the basis of the\nkink mechanism the temperature dependence of the flow stress is described for a\nwide class of materials. The theory of quantum mechanical dislocation\ntunnelling through the Peierls-Nabarro barriers is extended and compared with\nexperimental data on the plasticity of alkali halides, BCC and HCP metals at\nlow temperatures. The behavior of the flow stress at the range of athermic\nanomalies is modeled by changing the mechanism of the dislocation motion from\nthe thermally activated hopping over the barriers to the quantum tunnelling\nthrough them. Some results of previous calculations are represented in a more\nexplicit convenient for applications form. The pronounced effect of the\nswitching between the normal and the superconducting states on the flow stress\nof metals is explained on the basis of the change in the dissipative properties\nof the electron subsystem affecting the dislocation motion.\n",

        "abstract": "  We compute solutions of the Lagrangian-Averaged Navier-Stokes alpha-model\n(LANS) for significantly higher Reynolds numbers (up to Re 8300) than have\npreviously been accomplished. This allows sufficient separation of scales to\nobserve a Navier-Stokes (NS) inertial range followed by a 2nd LANS inertial\nrange. The analysis of the third-order structure function scaling supports the\npredicted l^3 scaling; it corresponds to a k^(-1) scaling of the energy\nspectrum. The energy spectrum itself shows a different scaling which goes as\nk^1. This latter spectrum is consistent with the absence of stretching in the\nsub-filter scales due to the Taylor frozen-in hypothesis employed as a closure\nin the derivation of LANS. These two scalings are conjectured to coexist in\ndifferent spatial portions of the flow. The l^3 (E(k) k^(-1)) scaling is\nsubdominant to k^1 in the energy spectrum, but the l^3 scaling is responsible\nfor the direct energy cascade, as no cascade can result from motions with no\ninternal degrees of freedom. We verify the prediction for the size of the LANS\nattractor resulting from this scaling. From this, we give a methodology either\nfor arriving at grid-independent solutions for LANS, or for obtaining a\nformulation of a LES optimal in the context of the alpha models. The fully\nconverged grid-independent LANS may not be the best approximation to a direct\nnumerical simulation of the NS equations since the minimum error is a balance\nbetween truncation errors and the approximation error due to using LANS instead\nof the primitive equations. Furthermore, the small-scale behavior of LANS\ncontributes to a reduction of flux at constant energy, leading to a shallower\nenergy spectrum for large alpha. These small-scale features, do not preclude\nLANS to reproduce correctly the intermittency properties of high Re flow.\n",

We\nexperimentally investigate micro-lasers of simple shapes (Fabry-Perot, square,\npentagon, and disk). Their lasing spectra consist mainly of almost equidistant\npeaks and the distance between peaks reveals the length of a quantized periodic\norbit. To measure this length with a good precision, it is necessary to take\ninto account different sources of refractive index dispersion. Our experimental\nand numerical results agree with the superscar model describing the formation\nof long-lived states in polygonal cavities. The limitations of the\ntwo-dimensional approximation are briefly discussed in connection with\nmicro-disks.\n",

        "abstract": "  A new framework for asset price dynamics is introduced in which the concept\nof noisy information about future cash flows is used to derive the price\nprocesses. In this framework an asset is defined by its cash-flow structure.\nEach cash flow is modelled by a random variable that can be expressed as a\nfunction of a collection of independent random variables called market factors.\nWith each such \"X-factor\" we associate a market information process, the values\nof which are accessible to market agents. Each information process is a sum of\ntwo terms; one contains true information about the value of the market factor;\nthe other represents \"noise\". The noise term is modelled by an independent\nBrownian bridge. The market filtration is assumed to be that generated by the\naggregate of the independent information processes. The price of an asset is\ngiven by the expectation of the discounted cash flows in the risk-neutral\nmeasure, conditional on the information provided by the market filtration. When\nthe cash flows are the dividend payments associated with equities, an explicit\nmodel is obtained for the share-price, and the prices of options on\ndividend-paying assets are derived. Remarkably, the resulting formula for the\nprice of a European call option is of the Black-Scholes-Merton type. The\ninformation-based framework also generates a natural explanation for the origin\nof stochastic volatility.\n",

The dependence of the critical Rm_c vs. the\nhydrodynamic Reynolds number Re is obtained for 1<Re<6700. In the limit Pm<<1,\nRm_c is ~3 times larger than for Pm>1. The stability curve Rm_c(Re) (and, it is\nargued, the nature of the dynamo) is substantially different from the case of\nthe simulations and liquid-metal experiments with a mean flow. It is not as yet\npossible to determine numerically whether the growth rate is ~Rm^{1/2} in the\nlimit Re>>Rm>>1, as should be the case if the dynamo is driven by the\ninertial-range motions. The magnetic-energy spectrum in the low-Pm regime is\nqualitatively different from the Pm>1 case and appears to develop a negative\nspectral slope, although current resolutions are insufficient to determine its\nasymptotic form. At 1<Rm<Rm_c, the magnetic fluctuations induced via the\ntangling by turbulence of a weak mean field are investigated and the\npossibility of a k^{-1} spectrum above the resistive scale is examined. At low\nRm<1, the induced fluctuations are well described by the quasistatic\napproximation; the k^{-11/3} spectrum is confirmed for the first time in direct\nnumerical simulations.\n",

The lifts of\ngeometric objects on tangent bundles are performed for certain classes of\nd-connections and frame transforms when the Riemann tensor is parametrized by\nconstant matrix coefficients. For such configurations, the flows of\nnon-stretching curves and corresponding bi-Hamilton and solitonic hierarchies\nencode information about Ricci flow evolution, Einstein spaces and exact\nsolutions in gravity and geometric mechanics. The applied methods were\nelaborated formally in Finsler geometry and allows us to develop the formalism\nfor generalized Riemann-Finsler and Lagrange spaces. Nevertheless, all\ngeometric constructions can be equivalently re-defined for the Levi Civita\nconnections and holonomic frames on (semi) Riemannian manifolds.\n",

Our analysis is motivated\nby the Laplace-Bernstein-Von Mises central limit theorem, which states that in\nlarge samples the posterior or quasi-posterior approaches a normal density.\nUsing the conditions required for the central limit theorem to hold, we\nestablish polynomial bounds on the computational complexity of general\nMetropolis random walks methods in large samples. Our analysis covers cases\nwhere the underlying log-likelihood or extremum criterion function is possibly\nnon-concave, discontinuous, and with increasing parameter dimension. However,\nthe central limit theorem restricts the deviations from continuity and\nlog-concavity of the log-likelihood or extremum criterion function in a very\nspecific manner.\n  Under minimal assumptions required for the central limit theorem to hold\nunder the increasing parameter dimension, we show that the Metropolis algorithm\nis theoretically efficient even for the canonical Gaussian walk which is\nstudied in detail. Specifically, we show that the running time of the algorithm\nin large samples is bounded in probability by a polynomial in the parameter\ndimension $d$, and, in particular, is of stochastic order $d^2$ in the leading\ncases after the burn-in period. We then give applications to exponential\nfamilies, curved exponential families, and Z-estimation of increasing\ndimension.\n",

Discussions of all these\ncriteria will be confronted with the established criteria of integrability or\nquantum chaos, and sometimes quite surprising conclusions are found. Some\nconjectures and interesting open problems in ergodic theory of the quantum many\nproblem are suggested.\n",

In the present paper we study and explain phenomenologically a\nconnection between dynamical, topological, and statistical properties of\nchaotic mixing and transport in the model flow in terms of dynamical traps,\nsingular zones in the phase space where particles may spend arbitrary long but\nfinite time [Zaslavsky, Phys. D {\\bf 168--169}, 292 (2002)]. The transport of\npassive particles is described in terms of lengths and durations of zonal\nflights which are events between two successive changes of sign of zonal\nvelocity. Some peculiarities of the respective probability density functions\nfor short flights are proven to be caused by the so-called rotational-islands\ntraps connected with the boundaries of resonant islands (including those of the\nvortex cores) filled with the particles moving in the same frame. Whereas, the\nstatistics of long flights can be explained by the influence of the so-called\nballistic-islands traps filled with the particles moving from a frame to frame.\n",

Integrability is proved systematically by constructing the\ngenerating function of the infinite set of modified integrals of motion. The\ncontribution of the defect to all orders is explicitely identified in terms of\na defect matrix. The underlying geometric picture is that those defects\ncorrespond to Backlund transformations localized at a given point. A\nclassification of defect matrices as well as the corresponding defect\nconditions is performed. The method is applied to a collection of well-known\nintegrable models and previous results are recovered (and extended) directly as\nspecial cases. Finally, a brief discussion of the classical $r$-matrix approach\nin this context shows the relation to inhomogeneous lattice models and the need\nto resort to lattice regularizations of integrable field theories with defects.\n",

        "abstract": "  In this paper, we propose a novel inference method for dynamic genetic\nnetworks which makes it possible to face with a number of time measurements n\nmuch smaller than the number of genes p. The approach is based on the concept\nof low order conditional dependence graph that we extend here in the case of\nDynamic Bayesian Networks. Most of our results are based on the theory of\ngraphical models associated with the Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). In this\nway, we define a minimal DAG G which describes exactly the full order\nconditional dependencies given the past of the process. Then, to face with the\nlarge p and small n estimation case, we propose to approximate DAG G by\nconsidering low order conditional independencies. We introduce partial qth\norder conditional dependence DAGs G(q) and analyze their probabilistic\nproperties. In general, DAGs G(q) differ from DAG G but still reflect relevant\ndependence facts for sparse networks such as genetic networks. By using this\napproximation, we set out a non-bayesian inference method and demonstrate the\neffectiveness of this approach on both simulated and real data analysis. The\ninference procedure is implemented in the R package 'G1DBN' freely available\nfrom the CRAN archive.\n",

Applying the\ngeneralized entropy we discuss its approximate behavior qualitatively, the\nentropy rate and the sensitive value q^* of the nonextensive parameter q, which\nmay exit in the interval (-2,2) nearby where the generalized entropy return to\nthe classical K-S entropy.\n",

In this paper, we derive the estimation\nbounds and associated maximum likelihood estimators for frequency offset\nestimation in a cooperative communication system. We show the benefit of\nadaptively tuning the frequency of the relay node in order to reduce estimation\nerror at the destination. We also derive an efficient estimation algorithm,\nbased on the correlation sequence of the data, which has mean squared error\nclose to the Cramer-Rao Bound.\n",

The purpose of this paper\nis to show that explosive instabilities can occur even in media that admit no\n3-wave mixing. Instead, the instability is caused by 4-wave mixing: four\nresonantly interacting wavetrains gain energy from a background, and all blow\nup in a finite time. Unlike singularities associated with self-focussing, these\nsingularities can occur with no spatial structure - the waves blow up\neverywhere in space, simultaneously.\n",

The behavior of these volumes is strongly influenced by the\nregular or chaotic nature of the motion, the number of deviation vectors, their\nlinear (in)dependence and the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents. The different\ntime evolution of these volumes can be used to identify rapidly and efficiently\nthe nature of the dynamics, leading to the introduction of quantities that\nclearly distinguish between chaotic behavior and quasiperiodic motion on\n$N$-dimensional tori. More specifically we introduce the Generalized Alignment\nIndex of order $k$ (GALI$_k$) as the volume of a generalized parallelepiped,\nwhose edges are $k$ initially linearly independent unit deviation vectors from\nthe studied orbit whose magnitude is normalized to unity at every time step.\nThe GALI$_k$ is a generalization of the Smaller Alignment Index (SALI)\n(GALI$_2$ $\\propto$ SALI). However, GALI$_k$ provides significantly more\ndetailed information on the local dynamics, allows for a faster and clearer\ndistinction between order and chaos than SALI and works even in cases where the\nSALI method is inconclusive.\n",

We consider a monodisperse granular gas\ndriven by a thermal wall of a three-dimensional rectangular container at zero\ngravity. The basic steady state of this system, as described by granular\nhydrodynamic equations, involves a denser and colder layer of granulate located\nat the wall opposite to the driving wall. When the inelastic energy loss is\nsufficiently high, the driven granular gas exhibits, in some range of average\ndensities, negative compressibility in the directions parallel to the driving\nwall. When the lateral dimensions of the container are sufficiently large, the\nnegative compressibility causes spontaneous symmetry breaking of the basic\nsteady state and a phase separation instability. Event-driven molecular\ndynamics simulations confirm and complement our theoretical predictions.\n",

Estimating the abundance of these\npatterns is of fundamental importance for assessing the statistical\nsignificance of matches in genomewide searches, and for predicting whether a\ngiven function has evolved many times in different species or arose from a\nsingle common ancestor. In this manuscript, we review in an integrated and\nself-contained manner some basic concepts of automata theory, generating\nfunctions and transfer matrix methods that are relevant to pattern analysis in\nbiological sequences. We formalize, in a general framework, the concept of\nMarkov chain embedding to analyze patterns in random strings produced by a\nmemoryless source. This conceptualization, together with the capability of\nautomata to recognize complicated patterns, allows a systematic analysis of\nproblems related to the occurrence and frequency of patterns in random strings.\nThe applications we present focus on the concept of synchronization of\nautomata, as well as automata used to search for a finite number of keywords\n(including sets of patterns generated according to base pairing rules) in a\ngeneral text.\n",

Analyzing ground\nstates of the systems with equal powers in the two components, we find a\nsymmetry-breaking phenomenon beyond a critical value of the squared $l^2$-norm.\nAsymmetric states, with unequal powers in their components, emerge through a\nsubcritical pitchfork bifurcation, which, for very weakly coupled lattices,\nchanges into a supercritical one. We identify the stability of various solution\nbranches. Dynamical manifestations of the symmetry breaking are studied by\nsimulating the evolution of the unstable branches. The results present the\nfirst example of spontaneous symmetry breaking in 2D lattice solitons. This\nfeature has no counterpart in the continuum limit, because of the collapse\ninstability in the latter case.\n",

We show that for convex billiards of constant width with time\nreversal symmetry and \"almost\" chaotic dynamics the energy level distribution\nis of GUE-type. The effect is due to the lack of ergodicity in the \"momentum\"\npart of the phase space and, as we argue, is generic in two dimensions.\nBesides, we show that certain billiards of constant width in multiply connected\ndomains are of interest in relation to the quantum ergodicity problem. These\nbilliards are quantum ergodic, but not classically ergodic.\n",

The field probability distribution function is completely specified by\nthe correlation $G(|\\bi{r}-\\bi{r}'|) = <\\Psi(\\bi{r}) \\Psi(\\bi{r}')>$.\n  Given an arbitrary $G(|\\bi{r}-\\bi{r}'|)$, we compute the two point\ncorrelation function of the point process on the line, and derive other\nstatistical measures (repulsion, rigidity) which characterize the short and\nlong range correlations of the intersection points. We use these statistical\nmeasures to quantitatively characterize the complex patterns displayed by\nvarious kinds of nodal networks. We apply these statistics in particular to\nnodal patterns of random waves and of eigenfunctions of chaotic billiards. Of\nspecial interest is the observation that for monochromatic random waves, the\nnumber variance of the intersections with long straight segments grows like $L\n\\ln L$, as opposed to the linear growth predicted by the percolation model,\nwhich was successfully used to predict other long range nodal properties of\nthat field.\n",

The QE state parameter qI,,\nthe relative recombination probability g, and a new parameter called\nquasi-stationary (QS) state parameter q*=qIg are used for the analysis of the\nTSL and TSC. The TSL and TSC curves and the temperature dependences of qI, q*,\ng, the recombination lifetime, and the occupancies of active traps and\nrecombination centers are numerically calculated for five sets of kinetic\nparameters and different heating rates. These calculation results show that:\n(1) the upper limit of the heating rate for presence of the QS state appears at\nhigher heating rate than that for the QE state when the retrapping process is\npresent, and (2) the TSL (TSC) curves in the QS state have the properties\nsimilar to those for the TSL (TSC) curves in the QE state. Approximate formulas\nfor calculation of the parameters qI and q* in the initial range of the TSL and\nTSC curves are derived and used in the heating-rate methods, proposed in this\nwork, for determination of those parameters from the calculated TSL curves.\n",

This paper considers\nthe interaction of multiple such simple multistable systems when they are\nembedded together into a larger dynamical \"supersystem.\" Attention is focused\non the network structure of the resulting set of coupled differential\nequations, and the consequences of this structure on the propensity of the\nembedded switches to act independently versus cooperatively. Specifically, it\nis argued that both larger average and larger variance of the node degree\ndistribution lead to increased switch independence. Given the frequency of\nempirical observations of high variance degree distributions (e.g., power-law)\nin biological networks, it is suggested that the results presented here may aid\nin identifying switch-integrating subnetworks as comparatively homogenous,\nlow-degree, substructures. Potential applications to ecological problems such\nas the relationship of stability and complexity are also briefly discussed.\n",

Many common estimation methods used in statistics produce such\nestimates. We show that these estimates can always be improved with no harm\nusing rearrangement techniques: The rearrangement methods, univariate and\nmultivariate, transform the original estimate to a monotonic estimate, and the\nresulting estimate is closer to the true curve in common metrics than the\noriginal estimate. We illustrate the results with a computational example and\nan empirical example dealing with age-height growth charts.\n",

Two types of localized eigenmodes, flat-phased and staggered, are\ndirectly measured. Nonlinear perturbations enhances localization in one type,\nand induce delocalization in the other. In a complementary approach, we study\nthe evolution on short time scales of $\\delta$-like wavepackets in the presence\nof disorder. A transition from ballistic wavepacket expansion to exponential\n(Anderson) localization is observed. We find an intermediate regime in which\nthe ballistic and localized components coexist while diffusive dynamics is\nabsent. Evidence is found for a faster transition into localization under\nnonlinear conditions.\n",

We show through\nthe simulation that in a small range of reduced Rayleigh number $r$ ($770 < r <\n890$) the 2D rolls move chaotically in a direction normal to the roll axis. The\nlateral shift of the rolls may lead to global flow reversal of the convective\nmotion. The chaotic traveling rolls are observed in simulation with {\\it\nfree-slip} as well as {\\it no-slip} boundary conditions on the velocity field.\nWe show that the traveling rolls and the flow reversal are due to an interplay\nbetween the real and imaginary parts of the critical modes.\n",

Due to inertia,\nparticles drift relative to the fluid. We show that the drift velocity is close\nto the Lagrangian velocity increments of turbulence at the particle relaxation\ntime. We demonstrate that the collective drift of two close particles makes\nthem see local velocity increments fluctuate fast and we introduce the\ncorresponding Langevin description for separation dynamics. This allows to\ndescribe the behavior of the Lyapunov exponent and give the analogue of\nRichardson's law for separation above viscous scale.\n",

        "abstract": "  In many applications, input data are sampled functions taking their values in\ninfinite dimensional spaces rather than standard vectors. This fact has complex\nconsequences on data analysis algorithms that motivate modifications of them.\nIn fact most of the traditional data analysis tools for regression,\nclassification and clustering have been adapted to functional inputs under the\ngeneral name of functional Data Analysis (FDA). In this paper, we investigate\nthe use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for functional data analysis and we\nfocus on the problem of curves discrimination. SVMs are large margin classifier\ntools based on implicit non linear mappings of the considered data into high\ndimensional spaces thanks to kernels. We show how to define simple kernels that\ntake into account the unctional nature of the data and lead to consistent\nclassification. Experiments conducted on real world data emphasize the benefit\nof taking into account some functional aspects of the problems.\n",

In Efron, Hastie,\nJohnstone & Tibshirani (2004) it is proved that the least angle regression\nalgorithm, with a small modification, solves the lasso regression problem. Here\nwe give an analogous result for incremental forward stagewise regression,\nshowing that it solves a version of the lasso problem that enforces\nmonotonicity. One consequence of this is as follows: while lasso makes optimal\nprogress in terms of reducing the residual sum-of-squares per unit increase in\n$L_1$-norm of the coefficient $\\beta$, forward stage-wise is optimal per unit\n$L_1$ arc-length traveled along the coefficient path. We also study a condition\nunder which the coefficient paths of the lasso are monotone, and hence the\ndifferent algorithms coincide. Finally, we compare the lasso and forward\nstagewise procedures in a simulation study involving a large number of\ncorrelated predictors.\n",

        "abstract": "  We provide a new algorithm for the treatment of inverse problems which\ncombines the traditional SVD inversion with an appropriate thresholding\ntechnique in a well chosen new basis. Our goal is to devise an inversion\nprocedure which has the advantages of localization and multiscale analysis of\nwavelet representations without losing the stability and computability of the\nSVD decompositions. To this end we utilize the construction of localized frames\n(termed \"needlets\") built upon the SVD bases. We consider two different\nsituations: the \"wavelet\" scenario, where the needlets are assumed to behave\nsimilarly to true wavelets, and the \"Jacobi-type\" scenario, where we assume\nthat the properties of the frame truly depend on the SVD basis at hand (hence\non the operator). To illustrate each situation, we apply the estimation\nalgorithm respectively to the deconvolution problem and to the Wicksell\nproblem. In the latter case, where the SVD basis is a Jacobi polynomial basis,\nwe show that our scheme is capable of achieving rates of convergence which are\noptimal in the $L_2$ case, we obtain interesting rates of convergence for other\n$L_p$ norms which are new (to the best of our knowledge) in the literature, and\nwe also give a simulation study showing that the NEED-D estimator outperforms\nother standard algorithms in almost all situations.\n",

        "abstract": "  We study resonances of multidimensional chaotic map dynamics. We use the\ncalculus of variations to determine the additive forcing function that induces\nthe largest response, that is, the greatest deviation from the unperturbed\ndynamics. We include the additional constraint that only select degrees of\nfreedom be forced, corresponding to a very general class of problems in which\nnot all of the degrees of freedom in an experimental system are accessible to\nforcing. We find that certain Lagrange multipliers take on a fundamental\nphysical role as the efficiency of the forcing function and the effective\nforcing experienced by the degrees of freedom which are not forced directly.\nFurthermore, we find that the product of the displacement of nearby\ntrajectories and the effective total forcing function is a conserved quantity.\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of this methodology with several examples.\n",

We prove that the perturbed lattice asymptotically approaches a\nmodulated lattice.\n  More precisely, let $g$ be the genus of the hyperelliptic curve associated\nwith the unperturbed solution. We show that, apart from the phenomenon of the\nsolitons travelling on the quasi-periodic background, the $n/t$-pane contains\n$g+2$ areas where the perturbed solution is close to a finite-gap solution in\nthe same isospectral torus. In between there are $g+1$ regions where the\nperturbed solution is asymptotically close to a modulated lattice which\nundergoes a continuous phase transition (in the Jacobian variety) and which\ninterpolates between these isospectral solutions. In the special case of the\nfree lattice ($g=0$) the isospectral torus consists of just one point and we\nrecover the known result.\n  Both the solutions in the isospectral torus and the phase transition are\nexplicitly characterized in terms of Abelian integrals on the underlying\nhyperelliptic curve.\n  Our method relies on the equivalence of the inverse spectral problem to a\nmatrix Riemann--Hilbert problem defined on the hyperelliptic curve and\ngeneralizes the so-called nonlinear stationary phase/steepest descent method\nfor Riemann--Hilbert problem deformations to Riemann surfaces.\n",

The cores are linearly coupled by\ntunneling. Analysis of the corresponding system of linearly coupled\nGross-Pitaevskii equations (GPEs) reveals that spectral bandgaps of the single\nGPE split into subgaps. Symmetry breaking in two-component BEC solitons is\nstudied in cases of the attractive (AA) and repulsive (RR) nonlinearity in both\ntraps; the mixed situation, with repulsion in one trap and attraction in the\nother (RA), is considered too. In all the cases, stable asymmetric solitons are\nfound, bifurcating from symmetric or antisymmetric ones (and destabilizing\nthem), in the AA and RR systems, respectively. In either case, bi-stability is\npredicted, with a nonbifurcating stable branch, either antisymmetric or\nsymmetric, coexisting with asymmetric ones. Solitons destabilized by the\nbifurcation tend to rearrange themselves into their stable asymmetric\ncounterparts. The impact of a phase mismatch, between the OLs in the two cores\nis also studied. Also considered is a related model, for a binary BEC in a\nsingle-core trap with the OL, assuming that the two species (representing\ndifferent spin states of the same atom) are coupled by linear interconversion.\nIn that case, the symmetry-breaking bifurcations in the AA and RR models switch\ntheir character, if the inter-species nonlinear interaction becomes stronger\nthan the intra-species nonlinearity.\n",

For example, knowledge of how these objects formed can be used to\nimpose constraints on planetary formation theories. We have recently proposed a\nbinary-object formation model based on the notion of chaos-assisted capture.\nHere we present a more detailed analysis with calculations performed in the\nspatial (three-dimensional) three- and four-body Hill approximations. It is\nassumed that the potential binary partners are initially following heliocentric\nKeplerian orbits and that their relative motion becomes perturbed as these\nobjects undergo close encounters. First, the mass, velocity, and orbital\nelement distribu- tions which favour binary formation are identified in the\ncircular and elliptical Hill limits. We then consider intruder scattering in\nthe circular Hill four-body problem and find that the chaos-assisted capture\nmechanism is consistent with observed, apparently randomly distributed, binary\nmutual orbit inclinations. It also predicts asymmetric distributions of\nretrograde versus prograde orbits. The time-delay induced by chaos on particle\ntransport through the Hill sphere is analogous to the formation of a resonance\nin a chemical reaction. Implications for binary formation rates are considered\nand the 'fine-tuning' problem recently identified by Noll et al. (2007) is also\naddressed.\n",

In this paper, we study a finite version\nof the Pfaff lattice equation as a Hamiltonian system. In particular, we prove\nthe complete integrability in the sense of Arnold-Liouville, and using a moment\nmap, we describe the real isospectral varieties of the Pfaff lattice. The image\nof the moment map is a convex polytope whose vertices are identified as the\nfixed points of the flow generated by the Pfaff lattice.\n",

We discuss their existence criteria and\nsome of their properties using a recent mathematical description of\ntranscritical bifurcations in families of symplectic maps. We then present\nnumerical examples of transcritical bifurcations in a class of generalized\nH\\'enon-Heiles Hamiltonians and illustrate their stabilities and unfoldings\nunder various perturbations of the Hamiltonians. We demonstrate that for\nHamiltonians containing straight-line librating orbits, the transcritical\nbifurcation of these orbits is the typical case which occurs also in the\nabsence of any discrete symmetries, while their isochronous pitchfork\nbifurcation is an exception. We determine the normal forms of both types of\nbifurcations and derive the uniform approximation required to include\ntranscritically bifurcating orbits in the semiclassical trace formula for the\ndensity of states of the quantum Hamiltonian. We compute the coarse-grained\ndensity of states in a specific example both semiclassically and quantum\nmechanically and find excellent agreement of the results.\n",

        "abstract": "  Complex networks with expanding dimensions are studied, where the networks\nmay be directed and weighted, and network nodes are varying in discrete time in\nthe sense that some new nodes may be added and some old nodes may be removed\nfrom time to time. A model of such networks in computer data transmission is\ndiscussed. Each node on the network has fixed dimensionality, while the\ndimension of the whole network is defined by the total number of nodes. Based\non the spectacular properties of data transmission on computer networks, some\nnew concepts of stable and unstable networks differing from the classical\nLyapunov stability are defined. In particular, a special unstable network\nmodel, called devil network, is introduced and discussed. It is further found\nthat a variety of structures and connection weights affects the network\nstability substantially. Several criteria on stability, instability, and devil\nnetwork are established for a rather general class of networks, where some\nconditions are actually necessary and sufficient. Mathematically, this paper\nmakes a first attempt to rigorously formulate a fundamental issue of modeling\ndiscrete linear time-varying systems with expanding dimensions and study their\nbasic stability property.\n",

The classical theory predicts that\nthere is no localization below a threshold value for the strength of\ninteraction that is inversely proportional to the number of participating\natoms. In a full quantum treatment, however, we find that localized states\nexist for arbitrarily weak attractive or repulsive interactions for any number\n($>1$) of atoms. We further show, using an explicit solution of the\ntwo-particle bound state and an appropriate measure of entanglement, that the\nentanglement tends to a finite value in the limit of weak interactions. Coupled\nwith the non-existence of localization in an optimized quantum product state,\nwe conclude that the localization exists by virtue of entanglement.\n",

        "abstract": "  The extreme eigenvalues of connectivity matrices govern the influence of the\nnetwork structure on a number of network dynamical processes. A fundamental\nopen question is whether the eigenvalues of large networks are well represented\nby ensemble averages. Here we investigate this question explicitly and validate\nthe concept of ensemble averageability in random scale-free networks by showing\nthat the ensemble distributions of extreme eigenvalues converge to peaked\ndistributions as the system size increases. We discuss the significance of this\nresult using synchronization and epidemic spreading as example processes.\n",

Given discrete observations we estimate the covariation\nbetween the two diffusion parts and the co-jumps. The detection of the co-jumps\nallows to gain insight in the dependence structure of the jump components and\nhas important applications in finance. Our estimators are based on a threshold\nprinciple allowing to isolate the jumps. This work follows Gobbi and Mancini\n(2006) where the asymptotic normality for the estimator of the covariation,\nwith convergence speed given by the squared root of h, was obtained when the\njump components have finite activity. Here we show that the speed is the\nsquared root of h only when the activity of the jump components is moderate.\n",

A new predominant nonlocal viscous term is derived in the bottom\nkinematic boundary condition.

        "abstract": "  I propose a path integral description of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger\nHamiltonian, both in one and two dimensions, after mapping the real space model\nonto the time scale. While the lattice degrees of freedom are classical\nfunctions of time and are integrated out exactly, the electron particle paths\nare treated quantum mechanically. The method accounts for the variable range of\nthe electronic hopping processes. The free energy of the system and its\ntemperature derivatives are computed by summing at any $T$ over the ensemble of\nrelevant particle paths which mainly contribute to the total partition\nfunction. In the low $T$ regime, the {\\it heat capacity over T} ratio shows un\nupturn peculiar to a glass-like behavior. This feature is more sizeable in the\nsquare lattice than in the linear chain as the overall hopping potential\ncontribution to the total action is larger in higher dimensionality. The\neffects of the electron-phonon anharmonic interactions on the phonon subsystem\nare studied by the path integral cumulant expansion method.\n",

We demonstrate that the variational\nequations yield transient solutions, lasting for long time intervals, during\nwhich the length of deviation vectors of nearby orbits grows in time almost as\na power-law. The associated power exponent can be simply related to the\nentropic exponent for which the q-entropy exhibits a constant rate of increase.\nThis analysis leads to the definition of a new sensitive indicator\ndistinguishing regular from weakly chaotic orbits, that we call `Average Power\nLaw Exponent' (APLE). We compare the APLE with other established indicators of\nthe literature. In particular, we give examples of application of the APLE in\na) a thin separatrix layer of the standard map, b) the stickiness region around\nan island of stability in the same map, and c) the web of resonances of a 4D\nsymplectic map. In all these cases we identify weakly chaotic orbits exhibiting\nthe `metastable' behavior associated with the Tsallis q-entropy.\n",

        "abstract": "  A concentration graph associated with a random vector is an undirected graph\nwhere each vertex corresponds to one random variable in the vector. The absence\nof an edge between any pair of vertices (or variables) is equivalent to full\nconditional independence between these two variables given all the other\nvariables. In the multivariate Gaussian case, the absence of an edge\ncorresponds to a zero coefficient in the precision matrix, which is the inverse\nof the covariance matrix. It is well known that this concentration graph\nrepresents some of the conditional independencies in the distribution of the\nassociated random vector. These conditional independencies correspond to the\n\"separations\" or absence of edges in that graph. In this paper we assume that\nthere are no other independencies present in the probability distribution than\nthose represented by the graph. This property is called the perfect\nMarkovianity of the probability distribution with respect to the associated\nconcentration graph. We prove in this paper that this particular concentration\ngraph, the one associated with a perfect Markov distribution, can be determined\nby only conditioning on a limited number of variables. We demonstrate that this\nnumber is equal to the maximum size of the minimal separators in the\nconcentration graph.\n",

General results concerning the asymptotic behaviour of the\nsolution are presented. In particular, the conditions ensuring the convergence,\nrate of convergence and asymptotic expansion are established. The results\nconcerning the Polyak weighted averaging procedure are also presented.\n",

        "abstract": "  Optical gap solitons, which exist due to a balance of nonlinearity and\ndispersion due to a Bragg grating, can couple to acoustic waves through\nelectrostriction. This gives rise to a new species of ``gap-acoustic'' solitons\n(GASs), for which we find exact analytic solutions. The GAS consists of an\noptical pulse similar to the optical gap soliton, dressed by an accompanying\nphonon pulse. Close to the speed of sound, the phonon component is large. In\nsubsonic (supersonic) solitons, the phonon pulse is a positive (negative)\ndensity variation. Coupling to the acoustic field damps the solitons'\noscillatory instability, and gives rise to a distinct instability for\nsupersonic solitons, which may make the GAS decelerate and change direction,\nultimately making the soliton subsonic.\n",

        "abstract": "  Hall drift, i. e., transport of magnetic flux by the moving electrons giving\nrise to the electrical current, may be the dominant effect causing the\nevolution of the magnetic field in the solid crust of neutron stars. It is a\nnonlinear process that, despite a number of efforts, is still not fully\nunderstood. We use the Hall induction equation in axial symmetry to obtain some\ngeneral properties of nonevolving fields, as well as analyzing the evolution of\npurely toroidal fields, their poloidal perturbations, and current-free, purely\npoloidal fields. We also analyze energy conservation in Hall instabilities and\nwrite down a variational principle for Hall equilibria. We show that the\nevolution of any toroidal magnetic field can be described by Burgers' equation,\nas previously found in plane-parallel geometry. It leads to sharp current\nsheets that dissipate on the Hall time scale, yielding a stationary field\nconfiguration that depends on a single, suitably defined coordinate. This\nfield, however, is unstable to poloidal perturbations, which grow as their\nfield lines are stretched by the background electron flow, as in instabilities\nearlier found numerically. On the other hand, current-free poloidal\nconfigurations are stable and could represent a long-lived crustal field\nsupported by currents in the fluid stellar core.\n",

We show that there are two qualitatively\ndifferent dynamical regimes of the coupled breathers, either immovable or\nslowly-moving: the periodic transverse translation (wandering) of low-amplitude\nbreather between the chains, and the one-chain-localization of high-amplitude\nbreather. These two modes of coupled nonlinear excitations, which involve large\nnumber of anharmonic oscillators, can be mapped onto two solutions of a single\npendulum equation, detached by a separatrix mode. We also study two-chain\nbreathers, which can be considered as bound states of discrete breathers with\ndifferent symmetry and center locations in the coupled chains, and bifurcation\nof the anti-phase two-chain breather into the one-chain one. Delocalizing\ntransition of 1D breather in 2D system of a large number of parallel coupled\nnonlinear chains is described, in which the breather, initially excited in a\ngiven chain, abruptly spreads its vibration energy in the whole 2D system upon\ndecreasing breather frequency or amplitude below the threshold one. The\nthreshold breather frequency is above the cut off phonon frequency in 2D\nsystem, and the threshold breather amplitude scales as square root of the\ninter-chain coupling constant. Delocalizing transition of discrete vibrational\nbreather in 2D and 3D systems of coupled nonlinear chains has an analogy with\ndelocalizing transition for Bose-Einstein condensates in 2D and 3D optical\nlattices.\n",

We\nalso indicate a systematic method to study hierarchies of defect interactions\nbased on the network structure.\n",

Both simplifications can be\nimplemented using the coarse projective integration framework.

To\nfind how the Feynman relation applies to superfluid mixtures, we investigate a\nrotating two-component Bose-Einstein condensate, composed of bosons with\ndifferent masses. We find that in the case of sufficiently strong interspecies\nattraction, the vortex lattices of the two condensates lock and rotate at the\ndrive frequency, while the superfluids themselves rotate at two different\nvelocities, whose ratio is the ratio between the particle mass of the two\nspecies. In this paper, we characterize the vortex-locked state, establish its\nregime of stability, and find that it surives within a disk smaller than a\ncritical radius, beyond which vortices become unbound, and the two Bose-gas\nrings rotate together at the frequency of the external drive.\n",

        "abstract": "  We present a mathematically justifiable, computationally simple, sample\neigenvalue based procedure for estimating the number of high-dimensional\nsignals in white noise using relatively few samples. The main motivation for\nconsidering a sample eigenvalue based scheme is the computational simplicity\nand the robustness to eigenvector modelling errors which are can adversely\nimpact the performance of estimators that exploit information in the sample\neigenvectors.\n  There is, however, a price we pay by discarding the information in the sample\neigenvectors; we highlight a fundamental asymptotic limit of sample eigenvalue\nbased detection of weak/closely spaced high-dimensional signals from a limited\nsample size. This motivates our heuristic definition of the effective number of\nidentifiable signals which is equal to the number of \"signal\" eigenvalues of\nthe population covariance matrix which exceed the noise variance by a factor\nstrictly greater than 1+sqrt(Dimensionality of the system/Sample size). The\nfundamental asymptotic limit brings into sharp focus why, when there are too\nfew samples available so that the effective number of signals is less than the\nactual number of signals, underestimation of the model order is unavoidable (in\nan asymptotic sense) when using any sample eigenvalue based detection scheme,\nincluding the one proposed herein. The analysis reveals why adding more sensors\ncan only exacerbate the situation. Numerical simulations are used to\ndemonstrate that the proposed estimator consistently estimates the true number\nof signals in the dimension fixed, large sample size limit and the effective\nnumber of identifiable signals in the large dimension, large sample size limit.\n",

New\nalgorithms based on chaotic maps were suggested for protection of different\ntypes of multimedia data, especially digital images and videos in this period.\nHowever, many of them fundamentally were flawed by a lack of robustness and\nsecurity. For getting higher security and higher complexity, in the current\npaper, we introduce a new kind of symmetric key block cipher algorithm that is\nbased on \\emph{tripled chaotic maps}. In this algorithm, the utilization of two\ncoupling parameters, as well as the increased complexity of the cryptosystem,\nmake a contribution to the development of cryptosystem with higher security. In\norder to increase the security of the proposed algorithm, the size of key space\nand the computational complexity of the coupling parameters should be increased\nas well. Both the theoretical and experimental results state that the proposed\nalgorithm has many capabilities such as acceptable speed and complexity in the\nalgorithm due to the existence of two coupling parameter and high security.\nNote that the ciphertext has a flat distribution and has the same size as the\nplaintext. Therefore, it is suitable for practical use in secure\ncommunications.\n",

        "abstract": "  We consider processes with second order long range dependence resulting from\nheavy tailed durations. We refer to this phenomenon as duration-driven long\nrange dependence (DDLRD), as opposed to the more widely studied linear long\nrange dependence based on fractional differencing of an $iid$ process. We\nconsider in detail two specific processes having DDLRD, originally presented in\nTaqqu and Levy (1986), and Parke (1999). For these processes, we obtain the\nlimiting distribution of suitably standardized discrete Fourier transforms\n(DFTs) and sample autocovariances. At low frequencies, the standardized DFTs\nconverge to a stable law, as do the standardized sample autocovariances at\nfixed lags. Finite collections of standardized sample autocovariances at a\nfixed set of lags converge to a degenerate distribution. The standardized DFTs\nat high frequencies converge to a Gaussian law. Our asymptotic results are\nstrikingly similar for the two DDLRD processes studied. We calibrate our\nasymptotic results with a simulation study which also investigates the\nproperties of the semiparametric log periodogram regression estimator of the\nmemory parameter.\n",

The model is formulated in\nterms of local cell density and nutrient (oxygen) concentration. In the model\nthe rate of cell death depends on the local nutrient level. Thus heterogeneous\nnutrient distribution in tissue affects tumour structure and development. The\nexistence of automodel solutions is demonstrated and their properties are\ninvestigated. The results are compared to the properties of the\nKolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov and Fisher equations. Influence of the nutrient\ndistribution on the autowave speed selection as well as on the relaxation to\nautomodel solution is demonstrated. The model adequately describes the data,\nobserved in experiments.\n",

The properties of these solutions and their stability are investigated in\ndetail. The behaviour of combustion waves are demonstrated to have similarities\nwith the properties of nonadiabatic one-step combustion waves in that there is\na residual amount of fuel left behind the travelling waves and the solutions\ncan exhibit extinction. The difference between the nonadiabatic one-step and\nadiabatic two-step models is found in the behaviour of the combustion waves\nnear the extinction condition. It is shown that the flame velocity drops down\nto zero and a standing combustion wave is formed as the extinction condition is\nreached. Prospects of further work are also discussed.\n",

The collection of all the Wigner functions\ncorresponding to a full set of parallel quantum sections defines the\nHusimi-Wigner reresentation. It occupies an intermediate ground between drastic\nsuppression of nonclassical features, characteristic of Husimi functions, and\nthe daunting complexity of higher dimensional Wigner functions. After analysing\nthese features for simpler states, we exploit this new representation as a\nprobe of numerically computed eigenstates of chaotic Hamiltonians. The\nindividual two-dimensional Wigner functions resemble those of semiclassically\nquantized states, but the regular ring pattern is broken by dislocations.\n",

The symmetry problem of XXZ chain with a general cyclic $U_{\\sf\nq}(sl_2)$-representation is mapped onto the problem of studying $Q$-operator of\nsome special one-parameter family of generalized $\\tau^{(2)}$-models. In\nparticular, the spin-$\\frac{N-1}{2}$ XXZ chain model with ${\\sf q}^N=1$ and the\nhomogeneous $N$-state chiral Potts model at a specific superintegrable point\nare unified as one physical theory. By Baxter's method developed for producing\n$Q_{72}$-operator of the root-of-unity eight-vertex model, we construct the\n$Q_R, Q_L$- and $Q$-operators of a superintegrable $\\tau^{(2)}$-model, then\nidentify them with transfer matrices of the $N$-state chiral Potts model for a\npositive integer $N$.

The applicability of the method ranges from orthogonal\npolynomials (and generalizations) to Painleve transcendents, and integrable\nwave equations (KdV, NonLinear Schroedinger, etc.).\n  For the case of asymptotics of generalized orthogonal polynomials with\nrespect to varying complex weights we can recast the requirements for the\nCauchy-transform of the equilibrium measure into a problem of algebraic\ngeometry and harmonic analysis and completely solve the existence and\nuniqueness issue without relying on the minimization of a functional. This\naddresses and solves also the issue of the ``free boundary problem'',\ndetermining implicitly the curves where the zeroes of the orthogonal\npolynomials accumulate in the limit of large degrees and the support of the\nmeasure. The relevance to the quasi--linear Stokes phenomenon for Painleve\nequations is indicated. A numerical algorithm to find these curves in some\ncases is also explained.\n  Technical note: the animations included in the file can be viewed using\nAcrobat Reader 7 or higher.

The settings\nconsidered include periodic kicking of limit cycles, random kicks at Poisson\ntimes, and continuous-time driving by white noise. The forcing of a\nquasi-periodic model describing two coupled oscillators is also investigated.\nIn all cases, positive Lyapunov exponents are found in suitable parameter\nranges when the forcing is suitably directed.\n",

The general point of\nsuch a therapeutic optimization is how to apply control theory in the framework\nof structures in differential geometry by regarding parameter plane M of the\nFHN system as a differential manifold endowed with a metric. We suggest to\nequip M with a metric given by pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models of drug\nreceptor interaction.\n",

        "abstract": "  We consider the problem of estimating a density $f_X$ using a sample\n$Y_1,...,Y_n$ from $f_Y=f_X\\star f_{\\epsilon}$, where $f_{\\epsilon}$ is an\nunknown density. We assume that an additional sample\n$\\epsilon_1,...,\\epsilon_m$ from $f_{\\epsilon}$ is observed. Estimators of\n$f_X$ and its derivatives are constructed by using nonparametric estimators of\n$f_Y$ and $f_{\\epsilon}$ and by applying a spectral cut-off in the Fourier\ndomain. We derive the rate of convergence of the estimators in case of a known\nand unknown error density $f_{\\epsilon}$, where it is assumed that $f_X$\nsatisfies a polynomial, logarithmic or general source condition. It is shown\nthat the proposed estimators are asymptotically optimal in a minimax sense in\nthe models with known or unknown error density, if the density $f_X$ belongs to\na Sobolev space $H_{\\mathbh p}$ and $f_{\\epsilon}$ is ordinary smooth or\nsupersmooth.\n",

The configuration space is in general a\n2D Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifold and the determination of its\ngeometry is a part of the process of solution. Forces acting on the system\ninclude a part derived from a scalar potential and a part derived from a vector\npotential, associated with terms linear in velocities in the Lagrangian\nfunction of the system. The last cause time-irreversibility of the system. We\nconstruct 41 multi-parameter integrable systems of the type described in the\ntitle mostly on Riemannian manifolds. They are mostly new and cover all\npreviously known systems as special cases, corresponding to special values of\nthe parameters. Those include all known cases of motion of a particle in the\nplane and all known cases in the dynamics of rigid body. In the last field we\nintroduce a new integrable case related to Steklov's case of motion of a body\nin a liquid. Several new cases of motion in the plane, on the sphere and on the\npseudo-sphere or in the hyperbolic plane are found as special cases.\nProspective applications in mathematics and physics are also pointed out.\n",

Previous numerical works have reported that Hebbian\nlearning drives the system from chaos to a steady state through a sequence of\nbifurcations. Here, we interpret these results mathematically and show that\nthese effects, involving a complex coupling between neuronal dynamics and\nsynaptic graph structure, can be analyzed using Jacobian matrices, which\nintroduce both a structural and a dynamical point of view on the neural network\nevolution. Furthermore, we show that the sensitivity to a learned pattern is\nmaximal when the largest Lyapunov exponent is close to 0. We discuss how neural\nnetworks may take advantage of this regime of high functional interest.\n",

This results in filters suitable for nonlinear problems whose\nsolutions exhibit moving coherent features, such as thin interfaces in wildfire\nmodeling. The ensemble members are represented as the composition of one common\nstate with a spatial transformation, called registration mapping, plus a\nresidual. A fully automatic registration method is used that requires only\ngridded data, so the features in the model state do not need to be identified\nby the user. The morphing EnKF operates on a transformed state consisting of\nthe registration mapping and the residual. Essentially, the morphing EnKF uses\nintermediate states obtained by morphing instead of linear combinations of the\nstates.\n",

        "abstract": "  A new type of ensemble filter is proposed, which combines an ensemble Kalman\nfilter (EnKF) with the ideas of morphing and registration from image\nprocessing. This results in filters suitable for nonlinear problems whose\nsolutions exhibit moving coherent features, such as thin interfaces in wildfire\nmodeling. The ensemble members are represented as the composition of one common\nstate with a spatial transformation, called registration mapping, plus a\nresidual. A fully automatic registration method is used that requires only\ngridded data, so the features in the model state do not need to be identified\nby the user. The morphing EnKF operates on a transformed state consisting of\nthe registration mapping and the residual. Essentially, the morphing EnKF uses\nintermediate states obtained by morphing instead of linear combinations of the\nstates.\n",

        "abstract": "  In this paper, we present a spatial version of phytoplankton-zooplankton\nmodel that includes some important factors such as external periodic forces,\nnoise, and diffusion processes. The spatially extended\nphytoplankton-zooplankton system is from the original study by Scheffer [M\nScheffer, Fish and nutrients interplay determines algal biomass: a minimal\nmodel, Oikos \\textbf{62} (1991) 271-282]. Our results show that the spatially\nextended system exhibit a resonant patterns and frequency-locking phenomena.\nThe system also shows that the noise and the external periodic forces play a\nconstructive role in the Scheffer's model: first, the noise can enhance the\noscillation of phytoplankton species' density and format a large clusters in\nthe space when the noise intensity is within certain interval. Second, the\nexternal periodic forces can induce 4:1 and 1:1 frequency-locking and spatially\nhomogeneous oscillation phenomena to appear. Finally, the resonant patterns are\nobserved in the system when the spatial noises and external periodic forces are\nboth turned on. Moreover, we found that the 4:1 frequency-locking transform\ninto 1:1 frequency-locking when the noise intensity increased. In addition to\nelucidating our results outside the domain of Turing instability, we provide\nfurther analysis of Turing linear stability with the help of the numerical\ncalculation by using the Maple software. Significantly, oscillations are\nenhanced in the system when the noise term presents. These results indicate\nthat the oceanic plankton bloom may partly due to interplay between the\nstochastic factors and external forces instead of deterministic factors. These\nresults also may help us to understand the effects arising from undeniable\nsubject to random fluctuations in oceanic plankton bloom.\n",

In particular it is considered in\ndetail a subclass of these models, precisely those obtained from the Lorenz63\nby a small perturbation on the standard parameters, which includes for example\nthe forced Lorenz case in Ref.[6]. The paper is divided into two parts. In the\nfirst part the extremes of the mentioned state functions are considered, which\ndefine an invariant manifold, used to construct an appropriate Poincare surface\nfor our return map. From the experimental observation of the simple orbital\nmotion around the two unstable fixed points, together with the circumstance\nthat these orbits are classified by their energy or Casimir maximum, we\nconstruct a conceptually simple skeletal dynamics valid within our sub class,\nreproducing quite well the Lorenz map for Casimir. This energetic approach\nsheds some light on the physical mechanism underlying regime transitions. The\nsecond part of the paper is devoted to the investigation of a new type of\nmaximum energy based long term predictions, by which the knowledge of a\nparticular maximum energy shell amounts to the knowledge of the future\n(qualitative) behaviour of the system. It is shown that, in this respect, a\nlocal analysis of predictability is not appropriate for a complete\ncharacterization of this behaviour. A perspective on the possible extensions of\nthis type of predictability analysis to more realistic cases in (geo)fluid\ndynamics is discussed at the end of the paper.\n",

        "abstract": "  It is well known that complete prior ignorance is not compatible with\nlearning, at least in a coherent theory of (epistemic) uncertainty. What is\nless widely known, is that there is a state similar to full ignorance, that\nWalley calls near-ignorance, that permits learning to take place. In this paper\nwe provide new and substantial evidence that also near-ignorance cannot be\nreally regarded as a way out of the problem of starting statistical inference\nin conditions of very weak beliefs. The key to this result is focusing on a\nsetting characterized by a variable of interest that is latent. We argue that\nsuch a setting is by far the most common case in practice, and we show, for the\ncase of categorical latent variables (and general manifest variables) that\nthere is a sufficient condition that, if satisfied, prevents learning to take\nplace under prior near-ignorance. This condition is shown to be easily\nsatisfied in the most common statistical problems.\n",

The coalescence can be delayed and\nsometimes inhibited by injecting fresh air under the droplet. This can happen\nwhen the surface of the bath oscillates vertically, in this case the droplet\nbasically bounces on the interface. The lifetime of the droplet has been\nstudied with respect to the amplitude and the frequency of the excitation. The\nlifetime decreases when the acceleration increases. The thickness of the air\nfilm between the droplet and the bath has been investigated using interference\nfringes obtained when the system is illuminated by low pressure sodium lamps.\nMoreover, both the shape evolution and the motion of the droplet center of mass\nhave been recorded in order to evidence the phase offset between the\ndeformation and the trajectory. A short lifetime is correlated to a small air\nfilm thickness and to a large phase offset between the maximum of deformation\nand the minimum of the vertical position of the centre of mass.\n",

        "abstract": "  Network tomography has been regarded as one of the most promising\nmethodologies for performance evaluation and diagnosis of the massive and\ndecentralized Internet. This paper proposes a new estimation approach for\nsolving a class of inverse problems in network tomography, based on marginal\ndistributions of a sequence of one-dimensional linear projections of the\nobserved data. We give a general identifiability result for the proposed method\nand study the design issue of these one dimensional projections in terms of\nstatistical efficiency. We show that for a simple Gaussian tomography model,\nthere is an optimal set of one-dimensional projections such that the estimator\nobtained from these projections is asymptotically as efficient as the maximum\nlikelihood estimator based on the joint distribution of the observed data. For\npractical applications, we carry out simulation studies of the proposed method\nfor two instances of network tomography. The first is for traffic demand\ntomography using a Gaussian Origin-Destination traffic model with a power\nrelation between its mean and variance, and the second is for network delay\ntomography where the link delays are to be estimated from the end-to-end path\ndelays. We compare estimators obtained from our method and that obtained from\nusing the joint distribution and other lower dimensional projections, and show\nthat in both cases, the proposed method yields satisfactory results.\n",

The proposed procedure combines the sample and prior\ninformation, and selects significant variables for responses in a narrower\nregion where the true parameters lie. It increases the efficiency to choose the\ntrue model correctly. The proposed procedure can be executed by many\nconstrained quadratic programming methods and the initial estimator can be\nfound by least square or Monte Carlo method. The proposed procedure also enjoys\ngood theoretical properties. Moreover, the proposed procedure is not only used\nfor linear models but also can be used for generalized linear models({\\sl\nGLM}), Cox models, quantile regression models and many others with the help of\nWang and Leng (2007)'s LSA, which changes these models as the approximation of\nlinear models. The idea of combining sample and prior constraint information\ncan be also used for other modified lasso procedures. Some examples are used\nfor illustration of the idea of incorporating prior constraint information in\nvariable selection procedures.\n",

These regimes parallel the disordered and ordered regimes\nof equilibrium physical systems driven by thermal perturbations but here are\nshown to be relevant for non-thermal and non-equilibrium external influences on\ncomplex biological and social systems.

The synthetic electromagnetic fluctuations\nare generated through randomly placed magnetised ``clouds'' oscillating with a\nfrequency $\\omega$. We investigate the mean square displacements of particles\nin both position and velocity spaces. As $\\omega$ increases the particles\nundergo standard (Brownian--like) motion, anomalous diffusion and ballistic\nmotion in position space. Although in general the diffusion properties in\nvelocity space are not trivially related to those in position space, we find\nthat energization is present only when particles display anomalous diffusion in\nposition space. The anomalous character of the diffusion is only in the\nnon--standard values of the scaling exponents while the process is Gaussian.\n",

That model, which is developed\nwithin an Bayesian hierarchical framework, inherits the important feature of\nsuch models that its coefficients, treated as states of the process, can change\nwith time. Thus the model includes a time--varying site invariant mean field as\nwell as time varying coefficients for 24 and 12 diurnal cycle components. This\ncost of this model's great flexibility comes at the cost of computational\ncomplexity, forcing us to use an MCMC approach and to restrict application of\nour model domain to a small number of monitoring sites. We critically assess\nthis model and discover some of its weaknesses in this type of application.\n",

        "abstract": "  This paper considers M-estimation of a nonlinear regression model with\nmultiple change-points occuring at unknown times. The multi-phase random design\nregression model, discontinuous in each change-point, have an arbitrary error\n$\\epsilon$. In the case when the number of jumps is known, the M-estimator of\nlocations of breaks and of regression parameters are studied. These estimators\nare consistent and the distribution of the regression parameter estimators is\nGaussian. The estimator of each change-point converges, with the rate $n^{-1}$,\nto the smallest minimizer of the independent compound Poisson processes. The\nresults are valid for a large class of error distributions.\n",

The pioneering work by Nowak and May showed that large\ninitial populations of cooperators can survive and sustain cooperation in a\nsquare lattice with imitate-the-best evolutionary dynamics. We revisit this\nproblem in a cost-benefit formulation suitable for a number of biological\napplications. We show that if a fixed-amount reward is established for\ncooperators to share, a single cooperator can invade a population of defectors\nand form structures that are resilient to re-invasion even if the reward\nmechanism is turned off. We discuss analytically the case of the invasion by a\nsingle cooperator and present agent-based simulations for small initial\nfractions of cooperators. Large cooperation levels, in the sustainability\nrange, are found. In the conclusions we discuss possible applications of this\nmodel as well as its connections with other mechanisms proposed to promote the\nemergence of cooperation.\n",

        "abstract": "  Liesegang patterns emerge from precipitation processes and may be used to\nbuild bulk structures at submicron lengthscales. Thus they have significant\npotential for technological applications provided adequate methods of control\ncan be devised. Here we describe a simple, physically realizable\npattern-control based on the notion of driven precipitation, meaning that the\nphase-separation is governed by a guiding field such as, for example, a\ntemperature or a pH field. The phase-separation is modeled through a\nnon-autonomous Cahn-Hilliard equation whose spinodal is determined by the\nevolving guiding field. Control over the dynamics of the spinodal gives control\nover the velocity of the instability front which separates the stable and\nunstable regions of the system. Since the wavelength of the pattern is largely\ndetermined by this velocity, the distance between successive precipitation\nbands becomes controllable. We demonstrate the above ideas by numerical studies\nof a 1D system with diffusive guiding field. We find that the results can be\naccurately described by employing a linear stability analysis (pulled-front\ntheory) for determining the velocity -- local-wavelength relationship. From the\nperspective of the Liesegang theory, our results indicate that the so-called\nrevert patterns may be naturally generated by diffusive guiding fields.\n",

        "abstract": "  Linear structural error-in-variables models with univariate observations are\nrevisited for studying modified least squares estimators of the slope and\nintercept. New marginal central limit theorems (CLT's) are established for\nthese estimators, assuming the existence of four moments for the measurement\nerrors and that the explanatory variables are in the domain of attraction of\nthe normal law. The latter condition for the explanatory variables is used the\nfirst time, and is so far the most general in this context. It is also optimal,\nor nearly optimal, for our CLT's. Moreover, due to the obtained CLT's being in\nStudentized and self-normalized forms to begin with, they are a priori nearly,\nor completely, data-based, and free of unknown parameters of the joint\ndistribution of the error and explanatory variables. Consequently, they lead to\na variety of readily available, or easily derivable, large-sample approximate\nconfidence intervals (CI's) for the slope and intercept. In contrast, in\nrelated CLT's in the literature so far, the variances of the limiting normal\ndistributions, in general, are complicated and depend on various, typically\nunknown, moments of the error and explanatory variables. Thus, the\ncorresponding CI's for the slope and intercept in the literature, unlike those\nof the present paper, are available only under some additional model\nassumptions.\n",

        "abstract": "  The theory of optical dispersive shocks generated in propagation of light\nbeams through photorefractive media is developed. Full one-dimensional\nanalytical theory based on the Whitham modulation approach is given for the\nsimplest case of sharp step-like initial discontinuity in a beam with\none-dimensional strip-like geometry. This approach is confirmed by numerical\nsimulations which are extended also to beams with cylindrical symmetry. The\ntheory explains recent experiments where such dispersive shock waves have been\nobserved.\n",

In spite of the intimate\nrelationship between the two quantum models, the hidden supersymmetry in them\ndisplays essential differences. In particular, the kernel of the supercharges\nof the Poschl-Teller system, unlike the case of Lame equation, includes\nnonphysical states. By means of Lame equation, we clarify the nature of these\npeculiar states, and show that they encode essential information not only on\nthe original hyperbolic Poschl-Teller system, but also on its singular\nhyperbolic and trigonometric modifications, and reflect the intimate relation\nof the model to a free particle system.\n",

We analyze the dynamics of aerosols both\nin the absence and presence of gravitational effects, and both when the\ndynamics of the fluid particles is hyperbolic and nonhyperbolic. Permanent\ntrapping of aerosols much heavier than the advecting fluid is shown to occur in\nall these cases. This phenomenon is determined by the occurrence of multiple\nvortices in the flow and is predicted to happen for realistic particle-fluid\ndensity ratios.\n",

Passing over to the potential KP hierarchy, there is a corresponding\nscaling limit in the noncommutative case, which turns out to be the hierarchy\nof a `pseudodual chiral model' in 2+1 dimensions (`pseudodual' to a hierarchy\nextending Ward's (modified) integrable chiral model). Applying the scaling\nprocedure to a method generating exact solutions of a matrix (potential) KP\nhierarchy from solutions of a matrix linear heat hierarchy, leads to a\ncorresponding method that generates exact solutions of the matrix\ndispersionless potential KP hierarchy, i.e. the pseudodual chiral model\nhierarchy.

Random effects or mixed models\napproaches, which treat individual heterogeneity as part of the model error\nterm and use generalized least squares to estimate model parameters, are often\ncriticized because correlation between unobserved individual effects and other\nmodel variables can lead to biased and inconsistent parameter estimates.\nStarting with an examination of the relationship between random effects and\nfixed effects estimators in the standard unobserved effects model, this article\ndemonstrates through analysis and simulation that the mixed model approach has\na ``bias compression'' property under a general model for individual\nheterogeneity that can mitigate bias due to uncontrolled differences among\nindividuals. The general model is motivated by the complexities of longitudinal\nstudent achievement measures, but the results have broad applicability to\nlongitudinal modeling.\n",

The mean exponent averaged over the\nentire phase space behaves quite differently from all the other cumulants.\nWhereas the mean carries information about the strength of the interaction, and\nonly indirect information about dynamical correlations, the higher cumulants\ncarry information about dynamical correlations and essentially no information\nabout the interaction strength. In particular, the variance and higher\ncumulants of the exponent are very sensitive to dynamical correlations and\neasily detect the presence of very small islands of regular motion via their\nanomalous time-scalings. The average of the stability matrix' inverse trace is\neven more sensitive to the presence of small islands and has a seemingly\nfractal behavior in the standard map parameter. The usual accelerator modes and\nthe small islands created through double saddle node bifurcations, which come\nhalfway between the positions in interaction strength of the usual accelerator\nmodes, are clearly visible in the variance, whose time scaling is capable of\ndetecting the presence of islands as small as 0.01% of the phase space. We\nstudy these quantities with a local approximation to the trace of the stability\nmatrix which significantly simplifies the numerical calculations as well as\nallows for generalization of these methods to higher dimensions. We also\ndiscuss the nature of this local approximation in some detail.\n",

A sufficient condition for a\nfunction to behave chaotically is that its Schwarzian derivative is negative.\nIn this paper, we try to find a sufficient condition for a non-linear dynamical\nsystem to behave chaotically. The solution function of this system is a higher\ndegree polynomial. We define n-th Schwarzian derivative to examine its general\nproperties. Our analysis shows that the sufficient condition for chaotic\nbehavior of higher order polynomial is provided if its highest order three\nterms satisfy an inequality which is invariant under the degree of the\npolynomial and the condition is represented by Hankel determinant of order 2.\nAlso the n-th order polynomial can be considered to be the partial sum of real\nvariable analytic function. Let this analytic function be the solution of\nnon-linear differential equation, then the sufficient condition for the\nchaotical behavior of this function is the Hankel determinant of order 2\nnegative, where the elements of this determinant are the coefficient of the\nterms of n, n-1, n-2 in Taylor expansion.\n",

        "abstract": "  The Petviashvili's iteration method has been known as a rapidly converging\nnumerical algorithm for obtaining fundamental solitary wave solutions of\nstationary scalar nonlinear wave equations with power-law nonlinearity: \\\n$-Mu+u^p=0$, where $M$ is a positive definite self-adjoint operator and $p={\\rm\nconst}$. In this paper, we propose a systematic generalization of this method\nto both scalar and vector Hamiltonian equations with arbitrary form of\nnonlinearity and potential functions. For scalar equations, our generalized\nmethod requires only slightly more computational effort than the original\nPetviashvili method.\n",

        "abstract": "  It is generally accepted that many time series of practical interest exhibit\nstrong dependence, i.e., long memory. For such series, the sample\nautocorrelations decay slowly and log-log periodogram plots indicate a\nstraight-line relationship. This necessitates a class of models for describing\nsuch behavior. A popular class of such models is the autoregressive\nfractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA) which is a linear process.\nHowever, there is also a need for nonlinear long memory models. For example,\nseries of returns on financial assets typically tend to show zero correlation,\nwhereas their squares or absolute values exhibit long memory. Furthermore, the\nsearch for a realistic mechanism for generating long memory has led to the\ndevelopment of other nonlinear long memory models. In this chapter, we will\npresent several nonlinear long memory models, and discuss the properties of the\nmodels, as well as associated parametric andsemiparametric estimators.\n",

In particular, one family of solutions blow up at any point on a\nmoving plane with a line deleted, which may be used to study turbulence. Using\nFourier expansion and two families of our solutions, one can obtain\ndiscontinuous solutions that may be useful in study of shock waves. Another\nfamily of solutions are partially cylindrical invariant, contain two parameter\nfunctions of $t$ and structurally depend on two arbitrary polynomials, which\nmay be used to describe incompressible fluid in a nozzle.

E, 60 (1999), pp. 6172-6175] which combines the set of stabilising\ntransformations proposed by Schmelcher and Diakonos [Phys. Rev. Lett., 78\n(1997), pp. 4733-4736] with a modified semi-implicit Euler iterative scheme and\nseeding with periodic orbits of neighbouring periods, has been shown to be\nhighly efficient when applied to low-dimensional system. The difficulty in\napplying the algorithm to higher dimensional systems is mainly due to the fact\nthat the number of stabilising transformations grows extremely fast with\nincreasing system dimension. In this thesis, we construct stabilising\ntransformations based on the knowledge of the stability matrices of already\ndetected periodic orbits (used as seeds). The advantage of our approach is in a\nsubstantial reduction of the number of transformations, which increases the\nefficiency of the detection algorithm, especially in the case of\nhigh-dimensional systems. The performance of the new approach is illustrated by\nits application to the four-dimensional kicked double rotor map, a\nsix-dimensional system of three coupled H\\'enon maps and to the\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky system in the weakly turbulent regime.\n",

Probability density\nfunctions for generation intervals have been an important input for epidemic\nmodels and epidemic data analysis. In this paper, we specify a general\nstochastic SIR epidemic model and prove that the mean generation interval\ndecreases when susceptible persons are at risk of infectious contact from\nmultiple sources. The intuition behind this is that when a susceptible person\nhas multiple potential infectors, there is a ``race'' to infect him or her in\nwhich only the first infectious contact leads to infection. In an epidemic, the\nmean generation interval contracts as the prevalence of infection increases. We\ncall this global competition among potential infectors. When there is rapid\ntransmission within clusters of contacts, generation interval contraction can\nbe caused by a high local prevalence of infection even when the global\nprevalence is low. We call this local competition among potential infectors.\nUsing simulations, we illustrate both types of competition.\n  Finally, we show that hazards of infectious contact can be used instead of\ngeneration intervals to estimate the time course of the effective reproductive\nnumber in an epidemic. This approach leads naturally to partial likelihoods for\nepidemic data that are very similar to those that arise in survival analysis,\nopening a promising avenue of methodological research in infectious disease\nepidemiology.\n",

        "abstract": "  Streamer ionization fronts are pulled fronts propagating into a linearly\nunstable state; the spatial decay of the initial condition of a planar front\nselects dynamically one specific long time attractor out of a continuous\nfamily. A transverse stability analysis has to take these features into\naccount. In this paper we introduce a framework for this transverse stability\nanalysis, involving stable and unstable manifolds in a weighted space. Within\nthis framework, a numerical dynamical systems method for the calculation of the\ndispersion relation as an eigenvalue problem is defined and dispersion curves\nfor different values of the electron diffusion constant and of the electric\nfield ahead of the front are derived. Numerical solutions of the initial value\nproblem confirm the eigenvalue calculations. The numerical work is complemented\nwith analytical expressions for the dispersion relation in the limit of small\nand large wave numbers and with a fit formula for intermediate wave numbers.\nThis empirical fit supports the conjecture that the smallest unstable wave\nlength of the Laplacian instability is proportional to the diffusion length\nthat characterizes the leading edge of the pulled ionization front.\n",

Invoking basic consistency requirements pertaining to the\npreparation and composition of systems, as well as to the continuity of\nprobabilities, I show that the modified theory must have an internal symmetry\nisomorphic to the unitary group. It thus appears that the only consistent\nalgorithm for plausible reasoning about a continuum of hypotheses on the basis\nof finite evidence is furnished by quantum theory in complex Hilbert space.\n",

        "abstract": "  This article is concerned with the stability and long-time dynamics of\nstructures arising from a structureless state. The paradigm is suggested by\ndevelopmental biology, where morphogenesis is thought to result from a\ncompetition between chemical reactions and spatial diffusion. A system of two\nreaction-diffusion equations for the concentrations of two morphogens is\nreduced to a finite system of ordinary differential equations. The stability of\nbifurcated solutions of this system is analyzed, and the long-time asymptotic\nbehavior of the bifurcated solutions is established rigorously. The\nSchnakenberg and Gierer-Meinhardt equations are discussed as examples.\n",

        "abstract": "  Human heart rate is known to display complex fluctuations. Evidence of\nmultifractality in heart rate fluctuations in healthy state has been reported\n[Ivanov et al., Nature {\\bf 399}, 461 (1999)]. This multifractal character\ncould be manifested as a dependence on scale or beat number of the probability\ndensity functions (PDFs) of the heart rate increments. On the other hand, scale\ninvariance has been recently reported in a detrended analysis of healthy heart\nrate increments [Kiyono et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 93}, 178103 (2004)]. In\nthis paper, we resolve this paradox by clarifying that the scale invariance\nreported is actually exhibited by the PDFs of the sum of detrended healthy\nheartbeat intervals taken over different number of beats, and demonstrating\nthat the PDFs of detrended healthy heart rate increments are scale dependent.\nOur work also establishes that this scale invariance is a general feature of\nhuman heartbeat dynamics, which is shared by heart rate fluctuations in both\nhealthy and pathological states.\n",

To get explicit differential equations for dynamical systems\ncontaining the braids, we will use a certain function to define a tube\nneigbourhood of the braid. The second one, generating chaotic systems, is\nrealized by modeling the Smale horseshoe.\n",

Though this procedure\nis simple and useful in application indeed, the result can be unreliable when\nthe estimated standard errors of the standardized SN ratios are unbalanced.

Specific systems studied here are the terraces and domes observed\nat geothermal hot springs, such as those at Yellowstone National Park, and\nspeleothems, particularly stalactites and stalagmites. The theory couples the\nprecipitation front dynamics with shallow water flow, including corrections for\nturbulent drag and curvature effects. In the absence of capillarity and with a\nlaminar flow profile, the theory predicts a one-parameter family of steady\nstate solutions to the moving boundary problem describing the precipitation\nfront. These shapes match well the measured shapes near the vent at the top of\nobserved travertine domes. Closer to the base of the dome, the solutions\ndeviate from observations, and circular symmetry is broken by a fluting\npattern, which we show is associated with capillary forces causing thin film\nbreak-up. We relate our model to that recently proposed for stalactite growth,\nand calculate the linear stability spectrum of both travertine domes and\nstalactites. Lastly, we apply the theory to the problem of precipitation\npattern formation arising from turbulent flow down an inclined plane, and\nidentify a linear instability that underlies scale-invariant travertine terrace\nformation at geothermal hot springs.\n",

Our approach is not confined to the Ablowitz-Ladik hierarchy but\napplies generally to (1+1)-dimensional completely integrable soliton equations\nof differential-difference type.\n",

We carry out this task for the\nundercomplete case (uBSSD): we reduce the original uBSSD task via linear\nprediction to independent subspace analysis (ISA), which we can solve. As it\nhas been shown recently, applying temporal concatenation can also reduce uBSSD\nto ISA, but the associated ISA problem can easily become `high dimensional'\n[1]. The new reduction method circumvents this dimensionality problem. We\nperform detailed studies on the efficiency of the proposed technique by means\nof numerical simulations. We have found several advantages: our method can\nachieve high quality estimations for smaller number of samples and it can cope\nwith deeper temporal convolutions.\n",

        "abstract": "  We examine fully coherent two-pulse propagation in a lambda-type medium,\nunder two-photon resonance conditions and including inhomogeneous broadening.\nWe examine both the effects of short pulse preparation and the effects of\nmedium preparation. We contrast cases in which the two pulses have matched\nenvelopes or not, and contrast cases in which ground state coherence is present\nor not. We find that an extended interpretation of the Area Theorem for\nsingle-pulse self-induced transparency (SIT) is able to unify two-pulse\npropagation scenarios, including some aspects of electromagnetically-induced\ntransparency (EIT) and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS). We present numerical\nsolutions of both three-level and adiabatically reduced two-level density\nmatrix equations and Maxwell's equations, and show that many features of the\nsolutions are quickly interpreted with the aid of analytic solutions that we\nalso provide for restricted cases of pulse shapes and preparation of the\nmedium. In the limit of large one-photon detuning, we show that the two-level\nequations commonly used are not reliable for pulse Areas in the 2$\\pi$ range,\nwhich allows puzzling features of previous numerical work to be understood.\n",

We study\ndensity estimation and also discuss associated problems in nonparametric\nregression using the 2-mixing dependence measure. We compare the results under\n2-mixing with those derived under the assumption that the process is linear. In\nthe context of panel time series where one observes data from several\nindividuals, it is often too strong to assume the joint linearity of processes.\nInstead the methods developed in this paper enable us to quantify the\ndependence through 2-mixing which allows for nonlinearity. We propose an\nestimator of the panel mean function and obtain its rate of convergence. We\nshow that under certain conditions the rate of convergence can be improved by\nallowing the number of individuals in the panel to increase with time.\n",

        "abstract": "  The affine rank minimization problem consists of finding a matrix of minimum\nrank that satisfies a given system of linear equality constraints. Such\nproblems have appeared in the literature of a diverse set of fields including\nsystem identification and control, Euclidean embedding, and collaborative\nfiltering. Although specific instances can often be solved with specialized\nalgorithms, the general affine rank minimization problem is NP-hard. In this\npaper, we show that if a certain restricted isometry property holds for the\nlinear transformation defining the constraints, the minimum rank solution can\nbe recovered by solving a convex optimization problem, namely the minimization\nof the nuclear norm over the given affine space. We present several random\nensembles of equations where the restricted isometry property holds with\noverwhelming probability. The techniques used in our analysis have strong\nparallels in the compressed sensing framework. We discuss how affine rank\nminimization generalizes this pre-existing concept and outline a dictionary\nrelating concepts from cardinality minimization to those of rank minimization.\n",

        "abstract": "  In this paper, we present a unified approach to function approximation in\nreproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) that establishes a previously\nunrecognized optimality property for several well-known function approximation\ntechniques, such as minimum-norm interpolation, smoothing splines, and\npseudo-inverses. We consider the problem of approximating a function belonging\nto an arbitrary real-valued RKHS on R^d based on approximate observations of\nthe function. The observations are approximate in the sense that the actual\nobservations (i.e., the true function values) are known only to belong to a\nconvex set of admissible observations. We seek a minimax optimal approximation\nfor the function that minimizes the supremum of the RKHS norm on the error\nbetween the true function and the chosen approximation subject only to the\nconditions that the true function belongs to a uniformly bounded uncertainty\nset of functions that satisfy the constraints on the observations and that the\napproximation is a member of the RKHS. We refer to such a solution as a minimax\nrobust reconstruction. We characterize the solution to the minimax robust\nreconstruction problem and show that it is equivalent to solving a\nstraightforward convex optimization problem. We demonstrate that a minimax\nrobust reconstruction will generally be more stable than an approximation based\non interpolation through a nominal set of observations and that, subject to\nsome mild regularity conditions on the convex set of admissible observations,\nthe minimax robust reconstruction is unconditionally stable. We motivate our\nresults by characterizing the minimax robust reconstruction for several\nspecific convex observational models and discuss relationships with other\napproaches to function approximation.\n",

We find that the distributions of amplitude and wavenumber of pulses\ndepend only on the ratio of the two parameters of the amplification and the\nviscosity.

In order to prove this result we first establish a\ngeneral consistency result for SVMs and all stochastic processes that satisfy a\nmixing notion that is substantially weaker than $\\alpha$-mixing.\n",

        "abstract": "  In many modern applications, including analysis of gene expression and text\ndocuments, the data are noisy, high-dimensional, and unordered--with no\nparticular meaning to the given order of the variables. Yet, successful\nlearning is often possible due to sparsity: the fact that the data are\ntypically redundant with underlying structures that can be represented by only\na few features. In this paper we present treelets--a novel construction of\nmulti-scale bases that extends wavelets to nonsmooth signals. The method is\nfully adaptive, as it returns a hierarchical tree and an orthonormal basis\nwhich both reflect the internal structure of the data. Treelets are especially\nwell-suited as a dimensionality reduction and feature selection tool prior to\nregression and classification, in situations where sample sizes are small and\nthe data are sparse with unknown groupings of correlated or collinear\nvariables. The method is also simple to implement and analyze theoretically.\nHere we describe a variety of situations where treelets perform better than\nprincipal component analysis, as well as some common variable selection and\ncluster averaging schemes. We illustrate treelets on a blocked covariance model\nand on several data sets (hyperspectral image data, DNA microarray data, and\ninternet advertisements) with highly complex dependencies between variables.\n",

A testing procedure using an\nimplicit or explicit estimate of this quantity in order to improve its\nefficency is called adaptive. In this paper, we focus on the issue of False\nDiscovery Rate (FDR) control and we present new adaptive multiple testing\nprocedures with control of the FDR. First, in the context of assuming\nindependent $p$-values, we present two new procedures and give a unified review\nof other existing adaptive procedures that have provably controlled FDR. We\nreport extensive simulation results comparing these procedures and testing\ntheir robustness when the independence assumption is violated. The new proposed\nprocedures appear competitive with existing ones. The overall best, though, is\nreported to be Storey's estimator, but for a parameter setting that does not\nappear to have been considered before. Second, we propose adaptive versions of\nstep-up procedures that have provably controlled FDR under positive dependences\nand unspecified dependences of the $p$-values, respectively. While simulations\nonly show an improvement over non-adaptive procedures in limited situations,\nthese are to our knowledge among the first theoretically founded adaptive\nmultiple testing procedures that control the FDR when the $p$-values are not\nindependent.\n",

Although a Principal\nComponent Analysis (PCA), or equivalently a Empirical Orthogonal Functions\n(EOF) decomposition, is often applied on this purpose, it can only provide\nmeaningful results if the underlying multivariate distribution is Gaussian.\nIndeed, PCA is based on optimizing second order moments quantities and the\ncovariance matrix can only capture the full dependence structure for\nmultivariate Gaussian vectors. Whenever the application at hand can not satisfy\nthis normality hypothesis (e.g. precipitation data), alternatives and/or\nimprovements to PCA have to be developed and studied. To go beyond this second\norder statistics constraint that limits the applicability of the PCA, we take\nadvantage of the cumulant function that can produce higher order moments\ninformation. This cumulant function, well-known in the statistical literature,\nallows us to propose a new, simple and fast procedure to identify spatial\npatterns for non-Gaussian data. Our algorithm consists in maximizing the\ncumulant function. To illustrate our approach, its implementation for which\nexplicit computations are obtained is performed on three family of of\nmultivariate random vectors. In addition, we show that our algorithm\ncorresponds to selecting the directions along which projected data display the\nlargest spread over the marginal probability density tails.\n",

(The BRN is the expected\nnumber of new infections generated by one infected individual; the disease\nspreads if the BRN is larger than 1). A simple analytical expression for the\nBRN is derived on the basis of recent data on survival rates, transmission\nprobabilities, and levels of sexual activity. Baseline results show that in the\npopulation at large (characterized by equal numbers of men and women) the BRN\nis larger than 1 if every year each person has 82 sexual contacts with\ndifferent partners. the BRN is also larger than 1 for commercial sex workers\n(CSWs) and their clients (two populations of different sizes) if each CSW has\nabout 256 clients per year and each client visits one CSW every two weeks. A\nsensitivity analysis explores the effect on the BRN of a doubling (or a\nhalving) of the transmission probabilities. Implications and extensions are\ndiscussed.\n",

In\nthis paper we argue that a comprehensive probabilistic robustness analysis\nrequires a detailed evaluation of the robustness function and we show that such\nevaluation can be performed with essentially any desired accuracy and\nconfidence using algorithms with complexity linear in the dimension of the\nuncertainty space. Moreover, we show that the average memory requirements of\nsuch algorithms are absolutely bounded and well within the capabilities of\ntoday's computers.\n  In addition to efficiency, our approach permits control over statistical\nsampling error and the error due to discretization of the uncertainty radius.\nFor a specific level of tolerance of the discretization error, our techniques\nprovide an efficiency improvement upon conventional methods which is inversely\nproportional to the accuracy level; i.e., our algorithms get better as the\ndemands for accuracy increase.\n",

Here a network\nmodel is presented as an aid in understanding the role of social behavior and\nheterogeneous connectivity in determining the spatio-temporal patterns of\ndisease dynamics. We explore the controversial origins of long-term recurrent\noscillations believed to be characteristic to diseases that have a period of\ntemporary immunity after infection. In particular, we focus on sexually\ntransmitted diseases such as syphilis, where this controversy is currently\nunder review. Although temporary immunity plays a key role, it is found that in\nrealistic small-world networks, the social and sexual behavior of individuals\nalso has great influence in generating long-term cycles. The model generates\ncircular waves of infection with unusual spatial dynamics that depend on focal\nareas that act as pacemakers in the population. Eradication of the disease can\nbe efficiently achieved by eliminating the pacemakers with a targeted\nvaccination scheme. A simple difference equation model is derived, that\ncaptures the infection dynamics of the network model and gives insights into\ntheir origins and their eradication through vaccination.\n",

A stability analysis shows that solitons centered at a\nlattice (potential) maximum are unstable, as they drift toward the nearest\nlattice minimum. This instability can, however, be so weak that the soliton is\n``mathematically unstable'' but ``physically stable''. Stability of solitons\ncentered at a lattice minimum depends on the dimension of the problem and on\nthe nonlinearity. In the subcritical and supercritical cases, the lattice does\nnot affect the stability, leaving the solitons stable and unstable,\nrespectively. In contrast, in the critical case (e.g., a cubic nonlinearity in\ntwo transverse dimensions), the lattice stabilizes the (previously unstable)\nsolitons. The stability in this case can be so weak, however, that the soliton\nis ``mathematically stable'' but ``physically unstable''.\n",

For pedagogical reasons we perform the\nexplicit calculations for the case of the sine-Gordon model, taken as a\nprototype of soliton theories. We show that the energy and momentum are\nboundary terms for all the solutions on the orbit of the vacuum. That orbit\nincludes practically all the solutions of physical interest, namely solitons,\nmulti-solitons, breathers, and combinations of solitons and breathers. The\nexample of the mKdV equation is also given explicitly.\n",

We consider a finite\nBose-Fermi inter-atomic strength g_{bf} and both periodic and open boundary\nconditions. We find that with periodic boundary conditions, i.e. in a quasi-1D\nring, a uniform Bose-Fermi mixture is stable only with a large fermionic\ndensity. We predict that at small fermionic densities the ground state of the\nsystem displays demixing if g_{bf}>0 and may become a localized Bose-Fermi\nbright soliton for g_{bf}<0. Finally, we show, using variational and numerical\nsolution of the mean-field equations, that with open boundary conditions, i.e.\nin a quasi-1D cylinder, the Bose-Fermi bright soliton is the unique ground\nstate of the system with a finite number of particles, which could exhibit a\npartial mixing-demixing transition. In this case the bright solitons are\ndemonstrated to be dynamically stable. The experimental realization of these\nBose-Fermi bright solitons seems possible with present setups.\n",

In this paper, we\ninvestigate such a very old but also extremely important problem and\ndemonstrate that the difficulty for obtaining the exact solution is not\ninsurmountable. Unlike the classical approximate sample size method based on\nthe central limit theorem, we develop a new approach for computing the minimum\nsample size that does not require any approximation. Moreover, our approach\novercomes the conservatism of existing rigorous sample size methods derived\nfrom Bernoulli's theorem or Chernoff bounds.\n  Our computational machinery consists of two essential ingredients. First, we\nprove that the minimum of coverage probability with respect to a binomial\nparameter bounded in an interval is attained at a discrete set of finite many\nvalues of the binomial parameter. This allows for reducing infinite many\nevaluations of coverage probability to finite many evaluations. Second, a\nrecursive bounding technique is developed to further improve the efficiency of\ncomputation.\n",

        "abstract": "  A class of semi-parametric hazard/failure rates with a bathtub shape is of\ninterest. It does not only provide a great deal of flexibility over existing\nparametric methods in the modeling aspect but also results in a closed and\ntractable Bayes estimator for the bathtub-shaped failure rate (BFR). Such an\nestimator is derived to be a finite sum over two $\\mathbf{S}$-paths due to an\nexplicit posterior analysis in terms of two (conditionally independent)\n$\\mathbf{S}$-paths. These, newly discovered, explicit results can be proved to\nbe a Rao-Blackwellization of counterpart results in terms of partitions that\nare readily available by a specialization of James (2005)'s work. We develop\nboth iterative and non-iterative computational procedures based on existing\nefficient Monte Carlo methods for sampling one single $\\mathbf{S}$-path.\nNmerical simulations are given to demonstrate the practicality and the\neffectiveness of our methodology. Last but not least, two applications of the\nproposed method are discussed, of which one is about a Bayesian test for\nfailure rates and the other is related to modeling with covariates.\n",

A main difficulty is to compute the number of negative\neigenvalues of the linearized operator around the standing waves, and it is\novercome by a perturbation method and continuation arguments. Among others, in\nthe case of a repulsive defect, we show that the standing wave solution is\nstable in $\\hurad$ and unstable in $\\hu$ under subcritical nonlinearity.\nFurther we investigate the nature of instability: under critical or\nsupercritical nonlinear interaction, we prove the instability by blowup in the\nrepulsive case by showing a virial theorem and using a minimization method\ninvolving two constraints. In the subcritical radial case, unstable bound\nstates cannot collapse, but rather narrow down until they reach the stable\nregime (a {\\em finite-width instability}). In the non-radial repulsive case,\nall bound states are unstable, and the instability is manifested by a lateral\ndrift away from the defect, sometimes in combination with a finite-width\ninstability or a blowup instability.\n",

The system is subjected to both temporal and spatiotemporal\nperturbations. Through the analysis of the system's time evolution and its time\ncorrelations, we have obtained numerical evidence for two stochastic\nresonance-like behaviors. Such behavior is seen when a generalized\nsignal-to-noise ratio function are depicted as a function of the external noise\nintensity or as function of the system size. The underlying mechanism seems to\nbe associated to a noise-induced chaos reduction. The possible relevance of\nthose findings for an optimal climate prediction are discussed, using an\nanalysis of the noise effects on the evolution of finite perturbations and\nerrors.\n",

        "abstract": "  This paper defines and implements a non-Bayesian fusion rule for combining\ndensities of probabilities estimated by local (non-linear) filters for tracking\na moving target by passive sensors. This rule is the restriction to a strict\nprobabilistic paradigm of the recent and efficient Proportional Conflict\nRedistribution rule no 5 (PCR5) developed in the DSmT framework for fusing\nbasic belief assignments. A sampling method for probabilistic PCR5 (p-PCR5) is\ndefined. It is shown that p-PCR5 is more robust to an erroneous modeling and\nallows to keep the modes of local densities and preserve as much as possible\nthe whole information inherent to each densities to combine. In particular,\np-PCR5 is able of maintaining multiple hypotheses/modes after fusion, when the\nhypotheses are too distant in regards to their deviations. This new p-PCR5 rule\nhas been tested on a simple example of distributed non-linear filtering\napplication to show the interest of such approach for future developments. The\nnon-linear distributed filter is implemented through a basic particles\nfiltering technique. The results obtained in our simulations show the ability\nof this p-PCR5-based filter to track the target even when the models are not\nwell consistent in regards to the initialization and real cinematic.\n",

Here we argue and\ndemonstrate that, for typical complex networks, there usually exists an optimal\ncoupling gradient under which the maximum network synchronizability is\nachieved. After this optimal value, increase of coupling gradient could\ndeteriorate synchronization. We attribute the suppression of network\nsynchronization at large gradient to the phenomenon of network breaking, and\nfind that, in comparing with sparsely connected homogeneous networks, densely\nconnected heterogeneous networks have the superiority of adopting large\ngradient. The findings are supported by indirect simulations of eigenvalue\nanalysis and direct simulations of coupled nonidentical oscillator networks.\n",

Next, kinetic equations for particles with anisotropic interaction are\nconsidered and also cast into the DBV form. The moment dynamics for these\ndouble bracket kinetic equations is expressed as Lie-Darcy continuum equations\nfor densities of mass and orientation. We also show how to obtain a\nSmoluchowski model from a cold plasma-like moment closure of DBV. Thus, the\ndouble bracket kinetic framework serves as a unifying method for deriving\ndifferent types of dynamics, from density--orientation to Smoluchowski\nequations.

        "abstract": "  Simulated tempering (ST) is an established Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nmethod for sampling from a multimodal density $\\pi(\\theta)$. Typically, ST\ninvolves introducing an auxiliary variable $k$ taking values in a finite subset\nof $[0,1]$ and indexing a set of tempered distributions, say $\\pi_k(\\theta)\n\\propto \\pi(\\theta)^k$. In this case, small values of $k$ encourage better\nmixing, but samples from $\\pi$ are only obtained when the joint chain for\n$(\\theta,k)$ reaches $k=1$. However, the entire chain can be used to estimate\nexpectations under $\\pi$ of functions of interest, provided that importance\nsampling (IS) weights are calculated. Unfortunately this method, which we call\nimportance tempering (IT), can disappoint. This is partly because the most\nimmediately obvious implementation is na\\\"ive and can lead to high variance\nestimators. We derive a new optimal method for combining multiple IS estimators\nand prove that the resulting estimator has a highly desirable property related\nto the notion of effective sample size. We briefly report on the success of the\noptimal combination in two modelling scenarios requiring reversible-jump MCMC,\nwhere the na\\\"ive approach fails.\n",

        "abstract": "  A system of coupled chaotic bistable maps on a lattice with randomly\ndistributed impurities is investigated as a model for studying the phenomenon\nof phase growth in nonuniform media. The statistical properties of the system\nare characterized by means of the average size of spatial domains of equivalent\nspin variables that define the phases. It is found that the rate at which phase\ndomains grow becomes smaller when impurities are present and that the average\nsize of the resulting domains in the inhomogeneous state of the system\ndecreases when the density of impurities is increased. The phase diagram\nshowing regions where homogeneous, heterogeneous, and chessboard patterns occur\non the space of parameters of the system is obtained. A critical boundary that\nseparates the regime of slow growth of domains from the regime of fast growth\nin the heterogeneous region of the phase diagram is calculated. The transition\nbetween these two growth regimes is explained in terms of the stability\nproperties of the local phase configurations. Our results show that the\ninclusion of spatial inhomogeneities can be used as a control mechanism for the\nsize and growth velocity of phase domains forming in spatiotemporal systems.\n",

While the exact mechanism for the production of\notoacoustic emissions is not known, active motion of individual hair cells is\nthought to play a role. Two possible sources for otoacoustic emissions, both\nlocalized within individual hair cells, include somatic motility and hair\nbundle motility. Because physiological models of each of these systems are\nthought to be poised near a Hopf bifurcation, the dynamics of each can be\ndescribed by the normal form for a system near a Hopf bifurcation. Here we\ndemonstrate that experimental results from three-frequency suppression\nexperiments can be predicted based on the response of an array of\nnoninteracting Hopf oscillators tuned at different frequencies. This supports\nthe idea that active motion of individual hair cells contributes to active\nprocessing of sounds in the ear. Interestingly, the model suggests an\nexplanation for differing results recorded in mammals and nonmammals.\n",

To\ninvestigate this process, we use a reaction-diffusion system of\ninhibitor-activator type as a generic model of pathological wave propagation\nand set it close to bifurcation in the sub-excitable regime. We report the\ninfluence of various nonlocal connectivity schemes on wave propagation. Wave\npropagation can be suppressed with cross coupling inhibitor and activator for\nboth positive and negative coupling strength K, depending on the connection\nlength d. The area in the parameter plane (d,K) where this control goal is\nachieved resembles a Mexican-hat-type network connectivity. Our results suggest\nthat nonlocal synaptic transmission can control wave propagation, which may be\nof therapeutic value.\n",

This penalty\nregularizes (stabilizes) the optimization problem, encourages sparse portfolios\n(i.e. portfolios with only few active positions), and allows to account for\ntransaction costs. Our approach recovers as special cases the\nno-short-positions portfolios, but does allow for short positions in limited\nnumber. We implement this methodology on two benchmark data sets constructed by\nFama and French. Using only a modest amount of training data, we construct\nportfolios whose out-of-sample performance, as measured by Sharpe ratio, is\nconsistently and significantly better than that of the naive evenly-weighted\nportfolio which constitutes, as shown in recent literature, a very tough\nbenchmark.\n",

In\nparticular, many of the optimal penalties, derived in statistical literature,\ncan be used in our tests.

        "abstract": "  Drastic change in dynamics and statistics in a chemical reaction system,\ninduced by smallness in the molecule number, is reported. Through stochastic\nsimulations for random catalytic reaction networks, transition to a novel state\nis observed with the decrease in the total molecule number N, characterized by:\ni) large fluctuations in chemical concentrations as a result of intermittent\nswitching over several states with extinction of some molecule species and ii)\nstrong deviation of time averaged distribution of chemical concentrations from\nthat expected in the continuum limit, i.e., $N \\to \\infty$. The origin of\ntransition is explained by the deficiency of molecule leading to termination of\nsome reactions. The critical number of molecules for the transition is obtained\nas a function of the number of molecules species M and that of reaction paths\nK, while total reaction rates, scaled properly, are shown to follow a universal\nform as a function of NK/M.\n",

        "abstract": "  This paper reviews the role of expert judgement to support reliability\nassessments within the systems engineering design process. Generic design\nprocesses are described to give the context and a discussion is given about the\nnature of the reliability assessments required in the different systems\nengineering phases. It is argued that, as far as meeting reliability\nrequirements is concerned, the whole design process is more akin to a\nstatistical control process than to a straightforward statistical problem of\nassessing an unknown distribution. This leads to features of the expert\njudgement problem in the design context which are substantially different from\nthose seen, for example, in risk assessment. In particular, the role of experts\nin problem structuring and in developing failure mitigation options is much\nmore prominent, and there is a need to take into account the reliability\npotential for future mitigation measures downstream in the system life cycle.\nAn overview is given of the stakeholders typically involved in large scale\nsystems engineering design projects, and this is used to argue the need for\nmethods that expose potential judgemental biases in order to generate analyses\nthat can be said to provide rational consensus about uncertainties. Finally, a\nnumber of key points are developed with the aim of moving toward a framework\nthat provides a holistic method for tracking reliability assessment through the\ndesign process.\n",

        "abstract": "  This special volume of Statistical Sciences presents some innovative, if not\nprovocative, ideas in the area of reliability, or perhaps more appropriately\nnamed, integrated system assessment. In this age of exponential growth in\nscience, engineering and technology, the capability to evaluate the\nperformance, reliability and safety of complex systems presents new challenges.\nToday's methodology must respond to the ever-increasing demands for such\nevaluations to provide key information for decision and policy makers at all\nlevels of government and industry--problems ranging from international security\nto space exploration. We, the co-editors of this volume and the authors,\nbelieve that scientific progress in reliability assessment requires the\ndevelopment of processes, methods and tools that combine diverse information\ntypes (e.g., experiments, computer simulations, expert knowledge) from diverse\nsources (e.g., scientists, engineers, business developers, technology\nintegrators, decision makers) to assess quantitative performance metrics that\ncan aid decision making under uncertainty. These are highly interdisciplinary\nproblems. The principal role of statistical sciences is to bring statistical\nrigor, thinking and methodology to these problems.\n",

Email, for example, has database, processing, and user interface\ncomponents that can be distributed across a network and shared by users in\ndifferent locations or work groups. End-to-end performance and reliability\nmetrics describe the software quality experienced by these groups of users,\ntaking into account all the software components in the pipeline. Each user\nproduces only some of the data needed to understand the quality of the\napplication for the group, so group performance metrics are obtained by\ncombining summary statistics that each end computer periodically (and\nautomatically) sends to a central server. The group quality metrics usually\nfocus on medians and tail quantiles rather than on averages. Distributed\nquantile estimation is challenging, though, especially when passing large\namounts of data around the network solely to compute quality metrics is\nundesirable. This paper describes an Incremental Quantile (IQ) estimation\nmethod that is designed for performance monitoring at arbitrary levels of\nnetwork aggregation and time resolution when only a limited amount of data can\nbe transferred. Applications to both real and simulated data are provided.\n",

Recurrent event modeling possesses unique\nfacets making it different and more difficult to handle than single event\nsettings. For instance, the impact of an increasing number of event occurrences\nneeds to be taken into account, the effects of covariates should be considered,\npotential association among the interevent times within a unit cannot be\nignored, and the effects of performed interventions after each event occurrence\nneed to be factored in. A recent general class of models for recurrent events\nwhich simultaneously accommodates these aspects is described. Statistical\ninference methods for this class of models are presented and illustrated\nthrough applications to real data sets. Some existing open research problems\nare described.\n",

        "abstract": "  Many researchers have investigated first hitting times as models for survival\ndata. First hitting times arise naturally in many types of stochastic\nprocesses, ranging from Wiener processes to Markov chains. In a survival\ncontext, the state of the underlying process represents the strength of an item\nor the health of an individual. The item fails or the individual experiences a\nclinical endpoint when the process reaches an adverse threshold state for the\nfirst time. The time scale can be calendar time or some other operational\nmeasure of degradation or disease progression. In many applications, the\nprocess is latent (i.e., unobservable). Threshold regression refers to\nfirst-hitting-time models with regression structures that accommodate covariate\ndata. The parameters of the process, threshold state and time scale may depend\non the covariates. This paper reviews aspects of this topic and discusses\nfruitful avenues for future research.\n",

The first approaches presented in\nthis paper are concerned with the combination of multiple sources of\ninformation to assess the reliability of a single component. The second general\nset of methodology addresses the combination of multiple levels of data to\ndetermine system reliability. We then present developments for complex systems\nbeyond traditional series/parallel representations through the use of Bayesian\nnetworks and flowgraph models. We also include methodological contributions to\nresource allocation considerations for system relability assessment. We\nillustrate each method with applications primarily encountered at Los Alamos\nNational Laboratory.\n",

In the case where\nseveral systems of the same kind are observed, we show how observed covariates\nand unobserved heterogeneity can be included in the models. We also consider\nvarious approaches to trend testing. Modern reliability data bases usually\ncontain information on the type of failure, the type of maintenance and so\nforth in addition to the failure times themselves. Basing our work on recent\nliterature we present a framework where the observed events are modeled as\nmarked point processes, with marks labeling the types of events. Throughout the\npaper the emphasis is more on modeling than on statistical inference.\n",

        "abstract": "  Engineers in the manufacturing industries have used accelerated test (AT)\nexperiments for many decades. The purpose of AT experiments is to acquire\nreliability information quickly. Test units of a material, component, subsystem\nor entire systems are subjected to higher-than-usual levels of one or more\naccelerating variables such as temperature or stress. Then the AT results are\nused to predict life of the units at use conditions. The extrapolation is\ntypically justified (correctly or incorrectly) on the basis of physically\nmotivated models or a combination of empirical model fitting with a sufficient\namount of previous experience in testing similar units. The need to extrapolate\nin both time and the accelerating variables generally necessitates the use of\nfully parametric models. Statisticians have made important contributions in the\ndevelopment of appropriate stochastic models for AT data [typically a\ndistribution for the response and regression relationships between the\nparameters of this distribution and the accelerating variable(s)], statistical\nmethods for AT planning (choice of accelerating variable levels and allocation\nof available test units to those levels) and methods of estimation of suitable\nreliability metrics. This paper provides a review of many of the AT models that\nhave been used successfully in this area.\n",

        "abstract": "  We consider a gyroscopic system under the action of small dissipative and\nnon-conservative positional forces, which has its origin in the models of\nrotating bodies of revolution being in frictional contact. The spectrum of the\nunperturbed gyroscopic system forms a \"spectral mesh\" in the plane \"frequency\n-gyroscopic parameter\" with double semi-simple purely imaginary eigenvalues at\nzero value of the gyroscopic parameter. It is shown that dissipative forces\nlead to the splitting of the semi-simple eigenvalue with the creation of the\nso-called \"bubble of instability\" - a ring in the three-dimensional space of\nthe gyroscopic parameter and real and imaginary parts of eigenvalues, which\ncorresponds to complex eigenvalues. In case of full dissipation with a\npositive-definite damping matrix the eigenvalues of the ring have negative real\nparts making the bubble a latent source of instability because it can \"emerge\"\nto the region of eigenvalues with positive real parts due to action of both\nindefinite damping and non-conservative positional forces. In the paper, the\ninstability mechanism is analytically described with the use of the\nperturbation theory of multiple eigenvalues. As an example stability of a\nrotating circular string constrained by a stationary load system is studied in\ndetail. The theory developed seems to give a first clear explanation of the\nmechanism of self-excited vibrations in the rotating structures in frictional\ncontact, that is responsible for such well-known phenomena of acoustics of\nfriction as the squealing disc brake and the singing wine glass.\n",

On the basis of the\nsample to be released, and possibly some partial knowledge of the whole\npopulation, an agency which considers releasing the sample, has to estimate the\ndisclosure risk. Risk arises from non-empty sample cells which represent small\npopulation cells and from population uniques in particular. Therefore risk\nestimation requires assessing how many of the relevant population cells are\nlikely to be small. Various methods have been proposed for this task, and we\npresent a method in which estimation of a population cell frequency is based on\nsmoothing using a local neighborhood of this cell, that is, cells having\nsimilar or close values in all attributes. We provide some preliminary results\nand experiments with this method. Comparisons are made to two other methods: 1.\na log-linear models approach in which inference on a given cell is based on a\n``neighborhood'' of cells determined by the log-linear model. Such\nneighborhoods have one or some common attributes with the cell in question, but\nsome other attributes may differ significantly. 2 The Argus method in which\ninference on a given cell is based only on the sample frequency in the specific\ncell, on the sample design and on some known marginal distributions of the\npopulation, without learning from any type of ``neighborhood'' of the given\ncell, nor from any model which uses the structure of the table.\n",

In\nthis paper, we mainly investigate Barndorff-Nielsen's modified directed\nlikelihood ratio statistic, Severini's empirical adjustment, and DiCiccio and\nMartin's two modifications, involving the Bayesian approach and the conditional\nlikelihood ratio statistic. For each modification, two formats were employed to\napproximate the conditional cumulative distribution function; these are\nBarndorff-Nielson formats and the Lugannani and Rice formats. All\napproximations were applied to inference on the ratio of means for two\nindependent exponential random variables. We constructed one and two-sided\nhypotheses tests and used the actual sizes of the tests as the measurements of\naccuracy to compare those approximations.\n",

        "abstract": "  Yehuda Vardi introduced the term network tomography and was the first to\npropose and study how statistical inverse methods could be adapted to attack\nimportant network problems (Vardi, 1996). More recently, in one of his final\npapers, Vardi proposed notions of metrics on networks to define and measure\ndistances between a network's links, its paths, and also between different\nnetworks (Vardi, 2004). In this paper, we apply Vardi's general approach for\nnetwork metrics to a real data network by using data obtained from special data\nnetwork tools and testing procedures presented here. We illustrate how the\nmetrics help explicate interesting features of the traffic characteristics on\nthe network. We also adapt the metrics in order to condition on traffic passing\nthrough a portion of the network, such as a router or pair of routers, and show\nfurther how this approach helps to discover and explain interesting network\ncharacteristics.\n",

        "abstract": "  The notion of data depth has long been in use to obtain robust location and\nscale estimates in a multivariate setting. The depth of an observation is a\nmeasure of its centrality, with respect to a data set or a distribution. The\ndata depths of a set of multivariate observations translates to a\ncenter-outward ordering of the data. Thus, data depth provides a generalization\nof the median to a multivariate setting (the deepest observation), and can also\nbe used to screen for extreme observations or outliers (the observations with\nlow data depth). Data depth has been used in the development of a wide range of\nrobust and non-parametric methods for multivariate data, such as non-parametric\ntests of location and scale [Li and Liu (2004)], multivariate rank-tests [Liu\nand Singh (1993)], non-parametric classification and clustering [Jornsten\n(2004)], and robust regression [Rousseeuw and Hubert (1999)]. Many different\nnotions of data depth have been developed for multivariate data. In contrast,\ndata depth measures for functional data have only recently been proposed\n[Fraiman and Muniz (1999), L\\'{o}pez-Pintado and Romo (2006a)]. While the\ndefinitions of both of these data depth measures are motivated by the\nfunctional aspect of the data, the measures themselves are in fact invariant\nwith respect to permutations of the domain (i.e. the compact interval on which\nthe functions are defined). Thus, these measures are equally applicable to\nmultivariate data where there is no explicit ordering of the data dimensions.\nIn this paper we explore some extensions of functional data depths, so as to\ntake the ordering of the data dimensions into account.\n",

        "abstract": "  Coupled backward and forward wave amplitudes of an electromagnetic field\npropagating in a periodic and nonlinear medium at Bragg resonance are governed\nby the nonlinear coupled mode equations (NLCME). This system of PDEs, similar\nin structure to the Dirac equations, has gap soliton solutions that travel at\nany speed between 0 and the speed of light. A recently considered strategy for\nspatial trapping or capture of gap optical soliton light pulses is based on the\nappropriate design of localized defects in the periodic structure. Localized\ndefects in the periodic structure give rise to defect modes, which persist as\n{\\it nonlinear defect modes} as the amplitude is increased. Soliton trapping is\nthe transfer of incoming soliton energy to {\\it nonlinear} defect modes. To\nserve as targets for such energy transfer, nonlinear defect modes must be\nstable. We therefore investigate the stability of nonlinear defect modes.\nResonance among discrete localized modes and radiation modes plays a role in\nthe mechanism for stability and instability, in a manner analogous to the\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger / Gross-Pitaevskii (NLS/GP) equation. However, the\nnature of instabilities and how energy is exchanged among modes is considerably\nmore complicated than for NLS/GP due, in part, to a continuous spectrum of\nradiation modes which is unbounded above and below. In this paper we (a)\nestablish the instability of branches of nonlinear defect states which, for\nvanishing amplitude, have a linearization with eigenvalue embedded within the\ncontinuous spectrum, (b) numerically compute, using Evans function, the\nlinearized spectrum of nonlinear defect states of an interesting multiparameter\nfamily of defects, and (c) perform direct time-dependent numerical simulations\nin which we observe the exchange of energy among discrete and continuum modes.\n",

The courts based their decision on circumstantial\nevidence and upon the use of statistics. In the appeal court, the use of\nstatistical calculations was repealed but the use of \"data\" and \"statistical\ninsights\" were not excluded. The trial hinged importantly on the role of\nstatistics and data gathering. It appears that data selection and confounding\nfeature strongly in this case. The notion of \"nominal correlation\" can be used\nto highlight those two features. This suggests a mistrial with the conviction\nof an innocent person.\n",

This can be interpreted as an\nintermediate image between the microcanonical and the canonical pictures. By\nmaintaining the ergodic hypothesis over this ensemble, that is, the\nequiprobability of all its accessible states, the equivalence of this ensemble\nin the thermodynamic limit with the microcanonical and the canonical ensembles\nis suggested by means of geometrical arguments. The Maxwellian and the\nBoltzmann-Gibbs distributions are obtained from this formalism. In the\nappendix, the derivation of the Boltzmann factor from a new microcanonical\nimage of the canonical ensemble is also given.\n",

This family\nincludes hybrid models with stochastic volatility, stochastic interest-rates,\njumps and their non-hybrid counterparts. The methodology is applied to Heston's\nmodel. A bootstrapping algorithm is presented for calibration. A case study\nworks out the calibration of the time-dependent parameters to the volatility\nsurface of the Eurostoxx 50 index. The methodology is also applied to the\nanalytic valuation of forward start vanilla options driven by Heston's model.\nThis result is used to explore the forward skew of the case study.\n",

        "abstract": "  Topic models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), can be useful tools\nfor the statistical analysis of document collections and other discrete data.\nThe LDA model assumes that the words of each document arise from a mixture of\ntopics, each of which is a distribution over the vocabulary. A limitation of\nLDA is the inability to model topic correlation even though, for example, a\ndocument about genetics is more likely to also be about disease than X-ray\nastronomy. This limitation stems from the use of the Dirichlet distribution to\nmodel the variability among the topic proportions. In this paper we develop the\ncorrelated topic model (CTM), where the topic proportions exhibit correlation\nvia the logistic normal distribution [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 44 (1982)\n139--177]. We derive a fast variational inference algorithm for approximate\nposterior inference in this model, which is complicated by the fact that the\nlogistic normal is not conjugate to the multinomial. We apply the CTM to the\narticles from Science published from 1990--1999, a data set that comprises 57M\nwords. The CTM gives a better fit of the data than LDA, and we demonstrate its\nuse as an exploratory tool of large document collections.\n",

Effective management requires reliable\nmathematical models, so that the effects of management action can be predicted,\nand the uncertainty in these predictions quantified. These models must be able\nto predict the response of populations to anthropogenic change, while handling\nthe major sources of uncertainty. We describe a simple ``building block''\napproach to formulating discrete-time models. We show how to estimate the\nparameters of such models from time series of data, and how to quantify\nuncertainty in those estimates and in numbers of individuals of different types\nin populations, using computer-intensive Bayesian methods. We also discuss\nadvantages and pitfalls of the approach, and give an example using the British\ngrey seal population.\n",

De Moivre was one of the great\npioneers of classical probability theory. He also made seminal contributions in\nanalytic geometry, complex analysis and the theory of annuities. The first\nbiography of De Moivre, on which almost all subsequent ones have since relied,\nwas written in French by Matthew Maty. It was published in 1755 in the Journal\nbritannique. The authors provide here, for the first time, a complete\ntranslation into English of Maty's biography of De Moivre.

In this paper we present a novel\nsampling algorithm to solving the simultaneous mapping and localization (SLAM)\nproblem in indoor environments. We approach the problem from a Bayesian\nstatistics perspective. The data correspond to a set of range finder and\nodometer measurements, obtained at discrete time instants. We focus on the\nestimation of the posterior distribution over the space of possible maps given\nthe data. By exploiting different factorizations of this distribution, we\nderive three sampling algorithms based on importance sampling. We illustrate\nthe results of our approach by testing the algorithms with two real data sets\nobtained through robot navigation inside office buildings at Carnegie Mellon\nUniversity and the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile.\n",

A common approach to measuring\nenrichment is by cross-classifying genes according to membership in a\nfunctional category and membership on a selected list of significantly altered\ngenes. A small Fisher's exact test $p$-value, for example, in this $2\\times2$\ntable is indicative of enrichment. Other category analysis methods retain the\nquantitative gene-level scores and measure significance by referring a\ncategory-level statistic to a permutation distribution associated with the\noriginal differential expression problem. We describe a class of random-set\nscoring methods that measure distinct components of the enrichment signal. The\nclass includes Fisher's test based on selected genes and also tests that\naverage gene-level evidence across the category. Averaging and selection\nmethods are compared empirically using Affymetrix data on expression in\nnasopharyngeal cancer tissue, and theoretically using a location model of\ndifferential expression. We find that each method has a domain of superiority\nin the state space of enrichment problems, and that both methods have benefits\nin practice. Our analysis also addresses two problems related to\nmultiple-category inference, namely, that equally enriched categories are not\ndetected with equal probability if they are of different sizes, and also that\nthere is dependence among category statistics owing to shared genes. Random-set\nenrichment calculations do not require Monte Carlo for implementation. They are\nmade available in the R package allez.\n",

A coupled exploratory\nanalysis investigates cross-species extrapolation of gene expression\nsignatures--how these mouse-model signatures translate to humans. The latter\ninvolves exploration of sparse latent factor analysis of human observational\ndata and of how it relates to projected risk signatures derived in the animal\nmodels. The study also highlights a range of applied statistical and genomic\ndata analysis issues, including model specification, computational questions\nand model-based correction of experimental artifacts in DNA microarray data.\n",

In the same context, we\ndescribe an alternative approach based on computing the longest path in the\nnetwork after appropriate thresholding.\n  For the special case of curves, we also formalize the notion of `good\ncontinuation' between beamlets in any dimension, obtaining more economical\npiecewise linear approximation networks for curves.\n  We include some numerical experiments illustrating the use of the beamlet\nnetwork in characterizing the filamentarity content of 3D datasets, and show\nthat even a rudimentary notion of good continuity may bring substantial\nimprovement.\n",

The objective of the present\nstudy is to show that this popular belief is due to overly stringent\nrequirements that are typically imposed on the procedure rather than to its\nconservative nature. To get over its notorious conservatism, we advocate using\nthe Bonferroni selection rule as a procedure that controls the per family error\nrate (PFER). The present paper reports the first study of stability properties\nof the Bonferroni and Benjamini--Hochberg procedures. The Bonferroni procedure\nshows a superior stability in terms of the variance of both the number of true\ndiscoveries and the total number of discoveries, a property that is especially\nimportant in the presence of correlations between individual $p$-values. Its\nstability and the ability to provide strong control of the PFER make the\nBonferroni procedure an attractive choice in microarray studies.\n",

It turns out that one can capture many\nof the large scale features of the spatial covariance structure using a\nrelatively small number of terms in such an expansion, but the resulting fitted\nmodel provides a horrible fit to the data when evaluated via its likelihood\nbecause of its inability to describe accurately the process's local behavior.\nThus, there remains the challenge of developing computationally tractable\nmodels that capture both the large and small scale structure of these data.\n",

Numerical ocean models are essential for creating\nstorm surge forecasts for coastal areas. These models are driven primarily by\nthe surface wind forcings. Currently, the gridded wind fields used by ocean\nmodels are specified by deterministic formulas that are based on the central\npressure and location of the storm center. While these equations incorporate\nimportant physical knowledge about the structure of hurricane surface wind\nfields, they cannot always capture the asymmetric and dynamic nature of a\nhurricane. A new Bayesian multivariate spatial statistical modeling framework\nis introduced combining data with physical knowledge about the wind fields to\nimprove the estimation of the wind vectors. Many spatial models assume the data\nfollow a Gaussian distribution. However, this may be overly-restrictive for\nwind fields data which often display erratic behavior, such as sudden changes\nin time or space. In this paper we develop a semiparametric multivariate\nspatial model for these data. Our model builds on the stick-breaking prior,\nwhich is frequently used in Bayesian modeling to capture uncertainty in the\nparametric form of an outcome. The stick-breaking prior is extended to the\nspatial setting by assigning each location a different, unknown distribution,\nand smoothing the distributions in space with a series of kernel functions.\nThis semiparametric spatial model is shown to improve prediction compared to\nusual Bayesian Kriging methods for the wind field of Hurricane Ivan.\n",

The embedding optimally preserves\nthe local functional coupling between fMRI time series and provides a\nlow-dimensional coordinate system for detecting activated voxels. To compute\nthe embedding, we build a graph of functionally connected voxels. We use the\ncommute time, instead of the geodesic distance, to measure functional distances\non the graph. Because the commute time can be computed directly from the\neigenvectors of (a symmetric version) the graph probability transition matrix,\nwe use these eigenvectors to embed the dataset in low dimensions. After\nclustering the datasets in low dimensions, coherent structures emerge that can\nbe easily interpreted. We performed an extensive evaluation of our method\ncomparing it to linear and nonlinear techniques using synthetic datasets and in\nvivo datasets. We analyzed datasets from the EBC competition obtained with\nsubjects interacting in an urban virtual reality environment. Our exploratory\napproach is able to detect independently visual areas (V1/V2, V5/MT), auditory\nareas, and language areas. Our method can be used to analyze fMRI collected\nduring ``natural stimuli''.\n",

Indeed, a too\nlarge number of input variables to a model results in a too large number of\nparameters, leading to overfitting and poor generalization abilities. In this\npaper, we suggest the use of the mutual information measure to select variables\nfrom the initial set. The mutual information measures the information content\nin input variables with respect to the model output, without making any\nassumption on the model that will be used; it is thus suitable for nonlinear\nmodelling. In addition, it leads to the selection of variables among the\ninitial set, and not to linear or nonlinear combinations of them. Without\ndecreasing the model performances compared to other variable projection\nmethods, it allows therefore a greater interpretability of the results.\n",

        "abstract": "  The large number of spectral variables in most data sets encountered in\nspectral chemometrics often renders the prediction of a dependent variable\nuneasy. The number of variables hopefully can be reduced, by using either\nprojection techniques or selection methods; the latter allow for the\ninterpretation of the selected variables. Since the optimal approach of testing\nall possible subsets of variables with the prediction model is intractable, an\nincremental selection approach using a nonparametric statistics is a good\noption, as it avoids the computationally intensive use of the model itself. It\nhas two drawbacks however: the number of groups of variables to test is still\nhuge, and colinearities can make the results unstable. To overcome these\nlimitations, this paper presents a method to select groups of spectral\nvariables. It consists in a forward-backward procedure applied to the\ncoefficients of a B-Spline representation of the spectra. The criterion used in\nthe forward-backward procedure is the mutual information, allowing to find\nnonlinear dependencies between variables, on the contrary of the generally used\ncorrelation. The spline representation is used to get interpretability of the\nresults, as groups of consecutive spectral variables will be selected. The\nexperiments conducted on NIR spectra from fescue grass and diesel fuels show\nthat the method provides clearly identified groups of selected variables,\nmaking interpretation easy, while keeping a low computational load. The\nprediction performances obtained using the selected coefficients are higher\nthan those obtained by the same method applied directly to the original\nvariables and similar to those obtained using traditional models, although\nusing significantly less spectral variables.\n",

        "abstract": "  Combining the mutual information criterion with a forward feature selection\nstrategy offers a good trade-off between optimality of the selected feature\nsubset and computation time. However, it requires to set the parameter(s) of\nthe mutual information estimator and to determine when to halt the forward\nprocedure. These two choices are difficult to make because, as the\ndimensionality of the subset increases, the estimation of the mutual\ninformation becomes less and less reliable. This paper proposes to use\nresampling methods, a K-fold cross-validation and the permutation test, to\naddress both issues. The resampling methods bring information about the\nvariance of the estimator, information which can then be used to automatically\nset the parameter and to calculate a threshold to stop the forward procedure.\nThe procedure is illustrated on a synthetic dataset as well as on real-world\nexamples.\n",

When multiple\nco-evolving data streams are observed, an important task is to determine how\nthese streams depend on each other, accounting for dynamic dependence patterns\nwithout imposing any restrictive probabilistic law governing this dependence.\nIn this paper we argue that flexible least squares (FLS), a penalized version\nof ordinary least squares that accommodates for time-varying regression\ncoefficients, can be deployed successfully in this context. Our motivating\napplication is statistical arbitrage, an investment strategy that exploits\npatterns detected in financial data streams. We demonstrate that FLS is\nalgebraically equivalent to the well-known Kalman filter equations, and take\nadvantage of this equivalence to gain a better understanding of FLS and suggest\na more efficient algorithm. Promising experimental results obtained from a\nFLS-based algorithmic trading system for the S&P 500 Futures Index are\nreported.\n",

        "abstract": "  Quality of microarray gene expression data has emerged as a new research\ntopic. As in other areas, microarray quality is assessed by comparing suitable\nnumerical summaries across microarrays, so that outliers and trends can be\nvisualized, and poor quality arrays or variable quality sets of arrays can be\nidentified. Since each single array comprises tens or hundreds of thousands of\nmeasurements, the challenge is to find numerical summaries which can be used to\nmake accurate quality calls. To this end, several new quality measures are\nintroduced based on probe level and probeset level information, all obtained as\na by-product of the low-level analysis algorithms RMA/fitPLM for Affymetrix\nGeneChips. Quality landscapes spatially localize chip or hybridization\nproblems. Numerical chip quality measures are derived from the distributions of\nNormalized Unscaled Standard Errors and of Relative Log Expressions. Quality of\nchip batches is assessed by Residual Scale Factors. These quality assessment\nmeasures are demonstrated on a variety of datasets (spike-in experiments, small\nlab experiments, multi-site studies). They are compared with Affymetrix's\nindividual chip quality report.\n",

We\ninvestigate the efficient and accurate representation of structures in\ntwo-dimensional turbulence by applying statistical models directly to the\nsimulated vorticity field. Rather than extract the coherent portion of the\nimage from the background variation, as in the classical signal-plus-noise\nmodel, we present a model for individual vortices using the non-decimated\ndiscrete wavelet transform. A template image, supplied by the user, provides\nthe features to be extracted from the vorticity field. By transforming the\nvortex template into the wavelet domain, specific characteristics present in\nthe template, such as size and symmetry, are broken down into components\nassociated with spatial frequencies. Multivariate multiple linear regression is\nused to fit the vortex template to the vorticity field in the wavelet domain.\nSince all levels of the template decomposition may be used to model each level\nin the field decomposition, the resulting model need not be identical to the\ntemplate. Application to a vortex census algorithm that records quantities of\ninterest (such as size, peak amplitude, circulation, etc.) as the vorticity\nfield evolves is given. The multiresolution census algorithm extracts coherent\nstructures of all shapes and sizes in simulated vorticity fields and is able to\nreproduce known physical scaling laws when processing a set of voriticity\nfields that evolve over time.\n",

The indicator of integration used is the\nspread between the highest and the lowest among the London, Hamburg and Paris\ngold-silver prices. Three algorithms are combined to study this integration: a\nperiodization obtained with the SOM algorithm is confronted to the estimation\nof a two-regime Markov switching model, in order to give an interpretation of\nthe changes of regime; in the same time change-points are identified over the\nwhole period providing a more precise interpretation of the various types of\nregulation.\n",

We suggest that this approach be used to complement other existing\ntechniques to study the interdependence of the variables involved. According to\nour method the variance is expressed as a sum of orthogonal components,\nobtained as differences of conditional means, with respect to the qualitative\ncharacters. The resulting expression for the variance depends on the ordering\nin which the characters are considered. We suggest an algorithm which leads to\nan ordering which is deemed natural. The first set of data concerns the score\nachieved by a population of students, on an entrance examination, based on a\nmultiple choice test with 30 questions. In this case the qualitative characters\nare dyadic and correspond to correct or incorrect answer to each question. The\nsecond set of data concerns the delay in obtaining the degree for a population\nof graduates of Italian universities. The variance in this case is analyzed\nwith respect to a set of seven specific qualitative characters of the\npopulation studied (gender, previous education, working condition, parent's\neducational level, field of study, etc.)\n",

        "abstract": "  We consider the problem of pricing path-dependent options on a basket of\nunderlying assets using simulations. As an example we develop our studies using\nAsian options. Asian options are derivative contracts in which the underlying\nvariable is the average price of given assets sampled over a period of time.\nDue to this structure, Asian options display a lower volatility and are\ntherefore cheaper than their standard European counterparts. This paper is a\nsurvey of some recent enhancements to improve efficiency when pricing Asian\noptions by Monte Carlo simulation in the Black-Scholes model. We analyze the\ndynamics with constant and time-dependent volatilities of the underlying asset\nreturns. We present a comparison between the precision of the standard Monte\nCarlo method (MC) and the stratified Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS). In\nparticular, we discuss the use of low-discrepancy sequences, also known as\nQuasi-Monte Carlo method (QMC), and a randomized version of these sequences,\nknown as Randomized Quasi Monte Carlo (RQMC). The latter has proven to be a\nuseful variance reduction technique for both problems of up to 20 dimensions\nand for very high dimensions. Moreover, we present and test a new path\ngeneration approach based on a Kronecker product approximation (KPA) in the\ncase of time-dependent volatilities. KPA proves to be a fast generation\ntechnique and reduces the computational cost of the simulation procedure.\n",

In this\npaper we use a Bayesian dynamic generalised linear model (DGLM) to estimate\nthis relationship, which allows the standard linear or additive model to be\nextended in two ways: (i) the long-term trend and temporal correlation present\nin the health data can be modelled by an autoregressive process rather than a\nsmooth function of calendar time; (ii) the effects of air pollution are allowed\nto evolve over time. The efficacy of these two extensions are investigated by\napplying a series of dynamic and non-dynamic models to air pollution and\nmortality data from Greater London. A Bayesian approach is taken throughout,\nand a Markov chain monte carlo simulation algorithm is presented for inference.\nAn alternative likelihood based analysis is also presented, in order to allow a\ndirect comparison with the only previous analysis of air pollution and health\ndata using a DGLM.\n",

The theoretical properties of these\nestimators are examined, several new theoretical results are developed, and all\nestimators are systematically applied to various types of synthetic data and\nunder different conditions.\n  Our main focus is on the performance of these entropy estimators on the\n(binary) spike trains of 28 neurons recorded simultaneously for a one-hour\nperiod from the primary motor and dorsal premotor cortices of a monkey. We show\nhow the entropy estimates can be used to test for the existence of long-term\nstructure in the data, and we construct a hypothesis test for whether the\nrenewal process model is appropriate for these spike trains. Further, by\napplying the CTW algorithm we derive the maximum a posterior (MAP) tree model\nof our empirical data, and comment on the underlying structure it reveals.\n",

        "abstract": "  Least mean square-partial parallel interference cancelation (LMS-PPIC) is a\npartial interference cancelation using adaptive multistage structure in which\nthe normalized least mean square (NLMS) adaptive algorithm is engaged to obtain\nthe cancelation weights. The performance of the NLMS algorithm is mostly\ndependent to its step-size. A fixed and non-optimized step-size causes the\npropagation of error from one stage to the next one. When all user channels are\nbalanced, the unit magnitude is the principal property of the cancelation\nweight elements. Based on this fact and using a set of NLMS algorithms with\ndifferent step-sizes, the parallel LMS-PPIC (PLMS-PPIC) method is proposed. In\neach iteration of the algorithm, the parameter estimate of the NLMS algorithm\nis chosen to match the elements' magnitudes of the cancelation weight estimate\nwith unity. Simulation results are given to compare the performance of our\nmethod with the LMS-PPIC algorithm in three cases: balanced channel, unbalanced\nchannel and time varying channel.\n",

In this scheme at the receiver, the time\nvarying step-size is replied to the transmitter via a reliable feedback\nchannel.

We consider a structural model composed of three freely correlated\nequations for nonattrition/response, employment and wages. The model is\nestimated using microdata from 22,990 individuals who provided sufficient\ninformation in the first wave of the 1996-2001 panel. The main findings of the\npaper are that attrition is not random. Attritors and non-respondents likely\nare less attached to employment and come from low-income population. The\ncorrelation between non-attrition and employment is positive and statistically\nsignificant, though small. Also, wage estimates are biased upwards. Observed\nwages are on average higher than wages that would be observed if all the\nindividuals initially selected in the panel remained in the sample.\n",

        "abstract": "  Imaging in clinical oncology trials provides a wealth of information that\ncontributes to the drug development process, especially in early phase studies.\nThis paper focuses on kinetic modeling in DCE-MRI, inspired by mixed-effects\nmodels that are frequently used in the analysis of clinical trials. Instead of\nsummarizing each scanning session as a single kinetic parameter -- such as\nmedian $\\ktrans$ across all voxels in the tumor ROI -- we propose to analyze\nall voxel time courses from all scans and across all subjects simultaneously in\na single model. The kinetic parameters from the usual non-linear regression\nmodel are decomposed into unique components associated with factors from the\nlongitudinal study; e.g., treatment, patient and voxel effects. A Bayesian\nhierarchical model provides the framework in order to construct a data model, a\nparameter model, as well as prior distributions. The posterior distribution of\nthe kinetic parameters is estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nmethods. Hypothesis testing at the study level for an overall treatment effect\nis straightforward and the patient- and voxel-level parameters capture random\neffects that provide additional information at various levels of resolution to\nallow a thorough evaluation of the clinical trial. The proposed method is\nvalidated with a breast cancer study, where the subjects were imaged before and\nafter two cycles of chemotherapy, demonstrating the clinical potential of this\nmethod to longitudinal oncology studies.\n",

The approach is general in nature, but is applied here to\nthe case of air pollution. It uses a computer model involving ambient pollution\nand temperature inputs, to simulate the exposures experienced by individuals in\nan urban area, whilst incorporating the mechanisms that determine exposures.\nThe output from the model comprises a set of daily exposures for a sample of\nindividuals from the population of interest. These daily exposures are\napproximated by parametric distributions, so that the predictive exposure\ndistribution of a randomly selected individual can be generated. These\ndistributions are then incorporated into a hierarchical Bayesian framework\n(with inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation) in order to examine\nthe relationship between short-term changes in exposures and health outcomes,\nwhilst making allowance for long-term trends, seasonality, the effect of\npotential confounders and the possibility of ecological bias.\n  The paper applies this approach to particulate pollution (PM$_{10}$) and\nrespiratory mortality counts for seniors in greater London ($\\geq$65 years)\nduring 1997. Within this substantive epidemiological study, the effects on\nhealth of ambient concentrations and (estimated) personal exposures are\ncompared.\n",

        "abstract": "  Quantitative portfolio allocation requires the accurate and tractable\nestimation of covariances between a large number of assets, whose histories can\ngreatly vary in length. Such data are said to follow a monotone missingness\npattern, under which the likelihood has a convenient factorization. Upon\nfurther assuming that asset returns are multivariate normally distributed, with\nhistories at least as long as the total asset count, maximum likelihood (ML)\nestimates are easily obtained by performing repeated ordinary least squares\n(OLS) regressions, one for each asset. Things get more interesting when there\nare more assets than historical returns. OLS becomes unstable due to\nrank--deficient design matrices, which is called a \"big p small n\" problem. We\nexplore remedies that involve making a change of basis, as in principal\ncomponents or partial least squares regression, or by applying shrinkage\nmethods like ridge regression or the lasso. This enables the estimation of\ncovariances between large sets of assets with histories of essentially\narbitrary length, and offers improvements in accuracy and interpretation. We\nfurther extend the method by showing how external factors can be incorporated.\nThis allows for the adaptive use of factors without the restrictive assumptions\ncommon in factor models. Our methods are demonstrated on randomly generated\ndata, and then benchmarked by the performance of balanced portfolios using real\nhistorical financial returns. An accompanying R package called monomvn,\ncontaining code implementing the estimators described herein, has been made\nfreely available on CRAN.\n",

We suppose\nthat, as a first step, a data-based model selection (e.g. by preliminary\nhypothesis tests or minimizing AIC) is used to select a model. It is common\nstatistical practice to then construct a confidence interval for the parameter\nof interest based on the assumption that the selected model had been given to\nus a priori. This assumption is false and it can lead to a confidence interval\nwith poor coverage properties. We provide an easily-computed finite sample\nupper bound (calculated by repeated numerical evaluation of a double integral)\nto the minimum coverage probability of this confidence interval. This bound\napplies for model selection by any of the following methods: minimum AIC,\nminimum BIC, maximum adjusted R-squared, minimum Mallows' Cp and t-tests. The\nimportance of this upper bound is that it delineates general categories of\ndesign matrices and model selection procedures for which this confidence\ninterval has poor coverage properties. This upper bound is shown to be a finite\nsample analogue of an earlier large sample upper bound due to Kabaila and Leeb.\n",

We found evidence that the\nsimilarity measure induced by our approach concentrates information for\ndiscrimination. Classification has the same high performance than others VLMC\napproaches. Clustering is a harder task, though, but our approach for\nclustering is alignment free and automatic, and may lead to many interesting\nvariations by choosing other clustering or classification procedures that are\nbased on pre-computed similarity information, as the ones that performs\nclustering using flow simulation, see (Yona et al 2000, Enright et al, 2003).\n",

We treat the problem of estimating ancestral trees with time depth\nfrom binary trait data. Simple analysis of such data is problematic. Each\nhomology class of traits has a unique birth event on the tree, and the birth\nevent of a trait visible at the leaves is biased towards the leaves. We propose\na model-based analysis of such data, and present an MCMC algorithm that can\nsample from the resulting posterior distribution. Our model is based on using a\nbirth-death process for the evolution of the elements of sets of traits. Our\nanalysis correctly accounts for the removal of singleton traits, which are\ncommonly discarded in real data sets. We illustrate Bayesian inference for two\nbinary-trait data sets which arise in historical linguistics. The Bayesian\napproach allows for the incorporation of information from ancestral languages.\nThe marginal prior distribution of the root time is uniform. We present a\nthorough analysis of the robustness of our results to model mispecification,\nthrough analysis of predictive distributions for external data, and fitting\ndata simulated under alternative observation models. The reconstructed ages of\ntree nodes are relatively robust, whilst posterior probabilities for topology\nare not reliable.\n",

We obtain a bound on the error between the distribution of the number of\noccurrences of a word in a sequence (under a Markov model) and its Poisson\napproximation. A global bound is already given by a Chen-Stein method. Our\napproach, the psi-mixing method, gives local bounds. Since we only need the\nerror in the tails of distribution, the global uniform bound of Chen-Stein is\ntoo large and it is a better way to consider local bounds. We search for two\nthresholds on the number of occurrences from which we can regard the studied\nword as an over-represented or an under-represented one. A biological role is\nsuggested for these over- or under-represented words. Our method gives such\nthresholds for a panel of words much broader than the Chen-Stein method.\nComparing the methods, we observe a better accuracy for the psi-mixing method\nfor the bound of the tails of distribution. We also present the software PANOW\n(available at http://stat.genopole.cnrs.fr/software/panowdir/) dedicated to the\ncomputation of the error term and the thresholds for a studied word.\n",

Without formal models, simulation algorithms and\ncollections of physical objects must be used as models. Identification of\ncommon aspects of different realizations of the same packing process requires\nthe use of new descriptive statistics, many of which have yet to be developed.\nModel assessment will require the use of large samples of independent and\nidentically distributed realizations, rather than the large single stationary\nrealizations found in conventional spatial statistics. The development of\nprocedures for model assessment will resemble the development of thermodynamic\nmodels, and will be based on much exploration and experimentation rather than\non extensions of established statistical methods.\n",

Most methods of de-noising data of this kind do not explicitly\ntake into account the modality of the final estimate. The residual-based\nprocedure we propose uses the so-called taut string method, which minimizes the\nnumber of peaks subject to a tube constraint on the integrated data. The\nbaseline is identified by combining the result of the taut string with an\nestimate of the first derivative of the baseline obtained using a weighted\nsmoothing spline. Finally, each individual peak is expressed as the finite sum\nof kernels chosen from a parametric family.\n",

        "abstract": "  This paper explores Bayesian inference for a biased sampling model in\nsituations where the population of interest cannot be sampled directly, but\nrather through an indirect and inherently biased method. Observations are\nviewed as being the result of a multinomial sampling process from a tagged\npopulation which is, in turn, a biased sample from the original population of\ninterest. This paper presents several Gibbs Sampling techniques to estimate the\njoint posterior distribution of the original population based on the observed\ncounts of the tagged population. These algorithms efficiently sample from the\njoint posterior distribution of a very large multinomial parameter vector.\nSamples from this method can be used to generate both joint and marginal\nposterior inferences. We also present an iterative optimization procedure based\nupon the conditional distributions of the Gibbs Sampler which directly computes\nthe mode of the posterior distribution. To illustrate our approach, we apply it\nto a tagged population of messanger RNAs (mRNA) generated using a common\nhigh-throughput technique, Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE).\nInferences for the mRNA expression levels in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae\nare reported.\n",
