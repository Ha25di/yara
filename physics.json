        "abstract": "  The evolution of Earth-Moon system is described by the dark matter field\nfluid model proposed in the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004,\nAmerican Physical Society. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees\nwith this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the\nMoon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil\nevidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5\nbillion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche's limit. The result suggests\nthat the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the\nEarth-Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from\nEarth-Moon system data is 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1)m^(-1). This model predicts\nthat the Mars's rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate\nabout -4.38 x 10^(-22) rad s^(-2).\n",

In particular, this approach has been followed in a symmetric\nsector of loop quantum gravity known as loop quantum cosmology. Here we explore\ndifferent aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and\nthe polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derive\nthe polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theory\nand show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In the\nsecond part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse\nprocess in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back\nthe ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics. We consider several examples of\ninterest, including the harmonic oscillator, the free particle and a simple\ncosmological model.\n",

Numerical methods were devised to calculate\nresponse to shock and ramp compression, and ramp decompression, generalizing\nprevious solutions for scalar equations of state. The numerical methods were\nfound to be flexible and robust, and matched analytic results to a high\naccuracy. The basic ramp and shock solution methods were coupled to solve for\ncomposite deformation paths, such as shock-induced impacts, and shock\ninteractions with a planar interface between different materials. These\ncalculations capture much of the physics of typical material dynamics\nexperiments, without requiring spatially-resolving simulations. Example\ncalculations were made of loading histories in metals, illustrating the effects\nof plastic work on the temperatures induced in quasi-isentropic and\nshock-release experiments, and the effect of a phase transition.\n",

In particular we present a set\nof criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, YSO's, from the\nextensive background contamination by extra-galactic objects. We then discuss\nthe properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 such\nobjects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An\nadditional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified\nfrom the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of\nresults, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with\nthose of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling\nof the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects\nexhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with\nactively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly\ndebris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends\ndown to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.\nThe lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from\nextra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.\nA spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are\nmore highly clustered than the later stages and that the background\nextra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function\nas seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matches\nbetween several previous infrared and X-ray studies of the Serpens YSO\npopulation and our Spitzer data set.\n",

        "abstract": "  Results from spectroscopic observations of the Intermediate Polar (IP) EX Hya\nin quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin-modulated radial\nvelocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first\ntime in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600\nkm/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the\nouter edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion\ncurtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler\ntomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending\nfrom velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the\ntheoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and\nNorton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that\nextend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence\nfor overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,\nconfirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is\npresent during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and\nhgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the\nouter disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of\nmaterial along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and\nclose to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the\naccretion curtain model.\n",

Computations carried out\nwith a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson\nand Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to\ndynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look\nfor dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests\nthat high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by\nALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool\ngas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of\nthe solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of\nthe quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal\nsignificant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8\nmHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer\nperiods in network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as that\nprovided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation between the features\nwithin the solar atmosphere and for an adequate comparison with the output of\nthe comprehensive dynamic simulations.\n",

In the regime\nwhere itinerant electrons, instantaneous electron-phonon driven correlations\nand static distortions compete on similar energy scales, we find several\ninteresting results including (1) A crossover from band to Mott behavior in the\nspectral function, leading to hybrid band/Mott features in the spectral\nfunction for phonon frequencies slightly larger than the band width. (2) Since\nthe optical conductivity depends sensitively on the form of the spectral\nfunction, we show that such a regime should be observable through the low\nfrequency form of the optical conductivity. (3) The resistivity has a double\nkondo peak arrangement\n",

The performance of this technique\nwas studied empirically based on extensive simulations for 5 test cases using\nmany different discretizations. The quality of the extrapolation improves with\nrefining discretization reaching extraordinary performance especially for\ncubically shaped particles. A two order of magnitude decrease of error was\ndemonstrated. We also propose estimates of the extrapolation error, which were\nproven to be reliable. Finally we propose a simple method to directly separate\nshape and discretization errors and illustrated this for one test case.\n",

        "abstract": "  We propose an extrapolation technique that allows accuracy improvement of the\ndiscrete dipole approximation computations. The performance of this technique\nwas studied empirically based on extensive simulations for 5 test cases using\nmany different discretizations. The quality of the extrapolation improves with\nrefining discretization reaching extraordinary performance especially for\ncubically shaped particles. A two order of magnitude decrease of error was\ndemonstrated. We also propose estimates of the extrapolation error, which were\nproven to be reliable. Finally we propose a simple method to directly separate\nshape and discretization errors and illustrated this for one test case.\n",

We introduce and investigate globally (or\nintrinsically, free from local coordinates) many of the most important and most\ncommonly used special Finsler manifolds: locally Minkowskian, Berwald,\nLandesberg, general Landesberg, $P$-reducible, $C$-reducible,\nsemi-$C$-reducible, quasi-$C$-reducible, $P^{*}$-Finsler, $C^{h}$-recurrent,\n$C^{v}$-recurrent, $C^{0}$-recurrent, $S^{v}$-recurrent, $S^{v}$-recurrent of\nthe second order, $C_{2}$-like, $S_{3}$-like, $S_{4}$-like, $P_{2}$-like,\n$R_{3}$-like, $P$-symmetric, $h$-isotropic, of scalar curvature, of constant\ncurvature, of $p$-scalar curvature, of $s$-$ps$-curvature. The global\ndefinitions of these special Finsler manifolds are introduced. Various\nrelationships between the different types of the considered special Finsler\nmanifolds are found. Many local results, known in the literature, are proved\nglobally and several new results are obtained. As a by-product, interesting\nidentities and properties concerning the torsion tensor fields and the\ncurvature tensor fields are deduced. Although our investigation is entirely\nglobal, we provide; for comparison reasons, an appendix presenting a local\ncounterpart of our global approach and the local definitions of the special\nFinsler spaces considered.\n",

        "abstract": "  Potassium intercalation in graphite is investigated by first-principles\ntheory. The bonding in the potassium-graphite compound is reasonably well\naccounted for by traditional semilocal density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations. However, to investigate the intercalate formation energy from\npure potassium atoms and graphite requires use of a description of the graphite\ninterlayer binding and thus a consistent account of the nonlocal dispersive\ninteractions. This is included seamlessly with ordinary DFT by a van der Waals\ndensity functional (vdW-DF) approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. The\nuse of the vdW-DF is found to stabilize the graphite crystal, with crystal\nparameters in fair agreement with experiments. For graphite and\npotassium-intercalated graphite structural parameters such as binding\nseparation, layer binding energy, formation energy, and bulk modulus are\nreported. Also the adsorption and sub-surface potassium absorption energies are\nreported. The vdW-DF description, compared with the traditional semilocal\napproach, is found to weakly soften the elastic response.\n",

        "abstract": "  We derive masses and radii for both components in the single-lined eclipsing\nbinary HAT-TR-205-013, which consists of a F7V primary and a late M-dwarf\nsecondary. The system's period is short, $P=2.230736 \\pm 0.000010$ days, with\nan orbit indistinguishable from circular, $e=0.012 \\pm 0.021$. We demonstrate\ngenerally that the surface gravity of the secondary star in a single-lined\nbinary undergoing total eclipses can be derived from characteristics of the\nlight curve and spectroscopic orbit. This constrains the secondary to a unique\nline in the mass-radius diagram with $M/R^2$ = constant. For HAT-TR-205-013, we\nassume the orbit has been tidally circularized, and that the primary's rotation\nhas been synchronized and aligned with the orbital axis. Our observed line\nbroadening, $V_{\\rm rot} \\sin i_{\\rm rot} = 28.9 \\pm 1.0$ \\kms, gives a primary\nradius of $R_{\\rm A} = 1.28 \\pm 0.04$ \\rsun. Our light curve analysis leads to\nthe radius of the secondary, $R_{\\rm B} = 0.167 \\pm 0.006$ \\rsun, and the\nsemimajor axis of the orbit, $a = 7.54 \\pm 0.30 \\rsun = 0.0351 \\pm 0.0014$ AU.\nOur single-lined spectroscopic orbit and the semimajor axis then yield the\nindividual masses, $M_{\\rm B} = 0.124 \\pm 0.010$ \\msun and $M_{\\rm A} = 1.04\n\\pm 0.13$ \\msun. Our result for HAT-TR-205-013 B lies above the theoretical\nmass-radius models from the Lyon group, consistent with results from\ndouble-lined eclipsing binaries. The method we describe offers the opportunity\nto study the very low end of the stellar mass-radius relation.\n",

Spatial order and size order of SAQDs are\nimportant to the development of usable devices. It is likely that these two\ntypes of order are strongly linked; thus, a study of spatial order will also\nhave strong implications for size order. Here a study of spatial order is\nundertaken using a linear analysis of a commonly used model of SAQD formation\nbased on surface diffusion. Analytic formulas for film-height correlation\nfunctions are found that characterize quantum dot spatial order and\ncorresponding correlation lengths that quantify order. Initial atomic-scale\nrandom fluctuations result in relatively small correlation lengths (about two\ndots) when the effect of a wetting potential is negligible; however, the\ncorrelation lengths diverge when SAQDs are allowed to form at a near-critical\nfilm height. The present work reinforces previous findings about anisotropy and\nSAQD order and presents as explicit and transparent mechanism for ordering with\ncorresponding analytic equations. In addition, SAQD formation is by its nature\na stochastic process, and various mathematical aspects regarding statistical\nanalysis of SAQD formation and order are presented.\n",

        "abstract": "  We show that the globular cluster mass function (GCMF) in the Milky Way\ndepends on cluster half-mass density (rho_h) in the sense that the turnover\nmass M_TO increases with rho_h while the width of the GCMF decreases. We argue\nthat this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that\ninitially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation\ndriven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the\nobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central\nconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in\nwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by\n-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known\ninsensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal\n``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant\nvariation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven\ncluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.\nOur conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend\ninstead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal\nradii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative\nprescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties\n(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as\nrho_h. In all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the GCMF\nimplies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values\n(although falling towards the low end of this range). Our analysis does not\ndepend on any assumptions or information about velocity anisotropy in the\nglobular cluster system.\n",

        "abstract": "  We investigate dynamical properties of bright solitons with a finite\nbackground in the F=1 spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), based on an\nintegrable spinor model which is equivalent to the matrix nonlinear\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation with a self-focusing nonlineality. We apply the\ninverse scattering method formulated for nonvanishing boundary conditions. The\nresulting soliton solutions can be regarded as a generalization of those under\nvanishing boundary conditions. One-soliton solutions are derived in an explicit\nmanner. According to the behaviors at the infinity, they are classified into\ntwo kinds, domain-wall (DW) type and phase-shift (PS) type. The DW-type implies\nthe ferromagnetic state with nonzero total spin and the PS-type implies the\npolar state, where the total spin amounts to zero. We also discuss two-soliton\ncollisions. In particular, the spin-mixing phenomenon is confirmed in a\ncollision involving the DW-type. The results are consistent with those of the\nprevious studies for bright solitons under vanishing boundary conditions and\ndark solitons. As a result, we establish the robustness and the usefulness of\nthe multiple matter-wave solitons in the spinor BECs.\n",

        "abstract": "  We employ granular hydrodynamics to investigate a paradigmatic problem of\nclustering of particles in a freely cooling dilute granular gas. We consider\nlarge-scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can be\nneglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas dynamics with an\nadditional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We\nemploy Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary\nanalytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These\nsolutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in\na finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups\nsignal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up\ntime $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\\sim\n(t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while\nthe velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock\ndiscontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the\nsingularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas\npressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time\nclose to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density\nblowup, of the same type, may coexist with an \"ordinary\" shock, at which the\nhydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the\nexact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving\nthe ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. Furthermore, numerical solutions\nshow that the local features of the density blowup hold universally,\nindependently of details of the initial and boundary conditions.\n",

        "abstract": "  Statistical modeling of experimental physical laws is based on the\nprobability density function of measured variables. It is expressed by\nexperimental data via a kernel estimator. The kernel is determined objectively\nby the scattering of data during calibration of experimental setup. A physical\nlaw, which relates measured variables, is optimally extracted from experimental\ndata by the conditional average estimator. It is derived directly from the\nkernel estimator and corresponds to a general nonparametric regression. The\nproposed method is demonstrated by the modeling of a return map of noisy\nchaotic data. In this example, the nonparametric regression is used to predict\na future value of chaotic time series from the present one. The mean predictor\nerror is used in the definition of predictor quality, while the redundancy is\nexpressed by the mean square distance between data points. Both statistics are\nused in a new definition of predictor cost function. From the minimum of the\npredictor cost function, a proper number of data in the model is estimated.\n",

These are nearly the {\\it maximum speeds} that are\naccelerable by the gravity of two truncated CDM halos in a Hubble time even\nwithout the ram pressure. Consistency breaks down if one adopts higher end of\nthe error bars for the bullet gas speed (5000-5400km/s), and the bullet gas\nwould not be bound by the sub-cluster halo for the Hubble time. Models with\nV_{DM}~ 4500km/s ~ V_{gas} would invoke unrealistic large amount M_{CDM}=7x\n10^{15}Msun of CDM for a cluster containing only ~ 10^{14}Msun of gas.

As a corollary, it is\nshown that the formation of a black hole with an S**(n-2) x S**1 horizon from\nthat with an S**(n-1) horizon must be non-axisymmetric in asymptotically flat\nspace-times.\n",

At the order $\\cal{O}(\\alpha_s^2)$,\ntwist-four contributions from quark-quark (antiquark) rescattering also exhibit\nthe Landau-Pomeranchuck-Midgal (LPM) interference feature similar to gluon\nbremsstrahlung induced by multiple parton scattering. Compared to quark-gluon\nscattering, the modification, which is dominated by $t$-channel quark-quark\n(antiquark) scattering, is only smaller by a factor of $C_F/C_A=4/9$ times the\nratio of quark and gluon distributions in the medium. Such a modification is\nnot negligible for realistic kinematics and finite medium size. The\nmodifications to quark (antiquark) fragmentation functions from quark-antiquark\nannihilation processes are shown to be determined by the antiquark (quark)\ndistribution density in the medium. The asymmetry in quark and antiquark\ndistributions in nuclei will lead to different modifications of quark and\nantiquark fragmentation functions inside a nucleus, which qualitatively\nexplains the experimentally observed flavor dependence of the leading hadron\nsuppression in semi-inclusive DIS off nuclear targets. The quark-antiquark\nannihilation processes also mix quark and gluon fragmentation functions in the\nlarge fractional momentum region, leading to a flavor dependence of jet\nquenching in heavy-ion collisions.\n",

Despite progress in assembly and oriented synthesis, pristine\nSWNTs in aligned and close-packed form remain elusive and needed for high\ncurrent, speed and density devices through collective operations of parallel\nSWNTs. Here, we develop a Langmuir Blodgett method achieving monolayers of\naligned SWNTs with dense packing, central to which is a non covalent polymer\nfunctionalization by PmPV imparting high solubility and stability of SWNTs in\nan organic solvent DCE. Pressure cycling or annealing during LB film\ncompression reduces hysteresis and facilitates high degree alignment and\npacking of SWNTs characterized by microscopy and polarized Raman spectroscopy.\nThe monolayer SWNTs are readily patterned for device integration by\nmicrofabrication, enabling the highest currents 3mA through the narrowest\nregions packed with aligned SWNTs thus far.\n",

Single-crystal Nb films are first prepared on A-plane sapphire,\nfollowed by the evaporation of Al in an O2 background. The first stages of\nAl2O3 growth are layer-by-layer with hexagonal symmetry. Electron and x-ray\ndiffraction measurements indicate the Al2O3 initially grows clamped to the Nb\nlattice with a tensile strain near 10%. This strain relaxes with further\ndeposition, and beyond about 5 nm we observe the onset of island growth.\nDespite the asymmetric misfit between the Al2O3 film and the Nb under-layer,\nthe observed strain is surprisingly isotropic.\n",

The crystalline electric field (CEF) analysis of the inverse\nsusceptibility data reveals that the ground state and the first excited states\nof CeAg$_2$Ge$_2$ are closely spaced indicating a quasi-quartet ground state.\nThe specific heat data lend further support to the presence of closely spaced\nenergy levels.\n",

At the\npumping level growth, the clearly depined increasing of the number of\ncoexisting SE states has been observed both in real physical experiments and in\ncomputer simulations. This confirms the analytical estimations of the branching\ndensity in the phase space. The nature of the refractority of SE pulses is\nclosely connected with the pointed branching and reflects the crises of strange\nattractors, i.e. their collisions with unstable periodic components of the\nhigher branches of SE states in the nonautonomous microwave phonon laser.\n",

At fields \\mu0H\nbetween 0 and 5T, vortex liquid-glass transitions were found in the I-V\nisotherms. Consistently, the I-V curves measured at different temperatures show\na scaling behavior in the framework of quasi-two-dimension (quasi-2D) vortex\nglass theory. However, at \\mu0 H >= 5T, a finite dissipation was observed down\nto the lowest temperature here, T=1.7K, and the I-V isotherms did not scale in\nterms of any known scaling law, of any dimensionality. We suggest that this may\nbe caused by a mixture of \\sigma band vortices and \\pi band quasiparticles.\nInterestingly, the I-V curves at zero magnetic field can still be scaled\naccording to the quasi-2D vortex glass formalism, indicating an equivalent\neffect of self-field due to persistent current and applied magnetic field.\n",

Here we capture magnetic\n\"fingerprints\" of 1 billion Fe nanodots as they undergo a single domain to\nvortex state transition, using a first-order reversal curve (FORC) method. As\nthe nanodot size increases from 52 nm to 67 nm, the FORC diagrams reveal\nstriking differences, despite only subtle changes in their major hysteresis\nloops. The 52 nm nanodots exhibit single domain behavior and the coercivity\ndistribution extracted from the FORC distribution agrees well with a\ncalculation based on the measured nanodot size distribution. The 58 and 67 nm\nnanodots exhibit vortex states, where the nucleation and annihilation of the\nvortices are manifested as butterfly-like features in the FORC distribution and\nconfirmed by micromagnetic simulations. Furthermore, the FORC method gives\nquantitative measures of the magnetic phase fractions, and vortex nucleation\nand annihilation fields.\n",

To provide the community with an online repository of X-ray light\ncurves obtained with Swift. The light curves should be of the quality expected\nof published data, but automatically created and updated so as to be\nself-consistent and rapidly available. Methods. We have produced a suite of\nprograms which automatically generates Swift/XRT light curves of GRBs. Effects\nof the damage to the CCD, automatic readout-mode switching and pile-up are\nappropriately handled, and the data are binned with variable bin durations, as\nnecessary for a fading source.\n  Results. The light curve repository website\n(http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_curves) contains light curves, hardness ratios and\ndeep images for every GRB which Swift's XRT has observed. When new GRBs are\ndetected, light curves are created and updated within minutes of the data\narriving at the UK Swift Science Data Centre.\n",

        "abstract": "  We study the interaction between two adjacent but electrically isolated\nquantum point contacts (QPCs). At high enough source-drain bias on one QPC, the\ndrive QPC, we detect a finite electric current in the second, unbiased,\ndetector QPC. The current generated at the detector QPC always flows in the\nopposite direction than the current of the drive QPC. The generated current is\nmaximal, if the detector QPC is tuned to a transition region between its\nquantized conductance plateaus and the drive QPC is almost pinched-off. We\ninterpret this counterflow phenomenon in terms of an asymmetric phonon-induced\nexcitation of electrons in the leads of the detector QPC.\n",

Relaxation equations for shear stress tensors are\nsolved simultaneously with the energy-momentum conservation equations.\nComparison of evolution of ideal and viscous QGP fluid, initialized under the\nsame conditions, e.g. same equilibration time, energy density and velocity\nprofile, indicate that in a viscous dynamics, energy density or temperature of\nthe fluid evolve slowly, than in an ideal fluid. Cooling gets slower as\nviscosity increases. Transverse expansion also increases in a viscous dynamics.\nFor the first time we have also studied elliptic flow of 'quarks' in causal\nviscous dynamics.

        "abstract": "  By combining high-resolution HST and wide-field ground based observations, in\nultraviolet and optical bands, we study the Blue Stragglers Star (BSS)\npopulation of the galactic globular cluster M5 (NGC 5904) from its very central\nregions up to its periphery. The BSS distribution is highly peaked in the\ncluster center, decreases at intermediate radii and rises again outward. Such a\nbimodal distribution is similar to those previously observed in other globular\nclusters (M3, 47Tucanae, NGC6752). As for these clusters, dynamical simulations\nsuggest that, while the majority of BSS in M5 could be originated by stellar\ncollisions, a significant fraction (20-40%) of BSS generated by mass transfer\nprocesses in primordial binaries is required to reproduce the observed radial\ndistribution. A candidate BSS has been detected beyond the cluster tidal\nradius. If confirmed, this could represent an interesting case of an\n\"evaporating\" BSS.\n",

First we\nintegrate out only a single pair of conjugated modes with wave vectors +/- q.\nThen we are looking for the RG equation which would describe the transformation\nof the Hamiltonian under the integration over a shell Lambda - d Lambda < k <\nLambda, where d Lambda -> 0. We show that the known Wegner--Houghton equation\nis consistent with the assumption of a simple superposition of the integration\nresults for +/- q. The renormalized action can be expanded in powers of the\nphi^4 coupling constant u in the high temperature phase at u -> 0. We compare\nthe expansion coefficients with those exactly calculated by the diagrammatic\nperturbative method, and find some inconsistency. It causes a question in which\nsense the Wegner-Houghton equation is really exact.\n",

Various\nmechanisms, such as the hyperfine interaction with the surrounding nuclei, the\nDresselhaus spin-orbit coupling together with the electron--bulk-phonon\ninteraction, the $g$-factor fluctuations, the direct spin-phonon coupling due\nto the phonon-induced strain, and the coaction of the\nelectron--bulk/surface-phonon interaction together with the hyperfine\ninteraction are included. The relative contributions from these spin\ndecoherence mechanisms are compared in detail. In our calculation, the\nspin-orbit coupling is included in each mechanism and is shown to have marked\neffect in most cases. The equation-of-motion approach is applied in studying\nboth the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and the spin dephasing time $T_2$, either\nin Markovian or in non-Markovian limit. When many levels are involved at finite\ntemperature, we demonstrate how to obtain the spin relaxation time from the\nFermi Golden rule in the limit of weak spin-orbit coupling. However, at high\ntemperature and/or for large spin-orbit coupling, one has to use the\nequation-of-motion approach when many levels are involved. Moreover, spin\ndephasing can be much more efficient than spin relaxation at high temperature,\nthough the two only differs by a factor of two at low temperature.\n",

        "abstract": "  The magnetic and thermodynamic properties of spin-1/2 Heisenberg diamond\nchains are investigated in three different cases: (a) J1, J2, J3>0\n(frustrated); (b) J1, J3<0, J2>0 (frustrated); and (c) J1, J2>0, J3<0\n(non-frustrated). The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) technique is\ninvoked to study the properties of the system in the ground state, while the\ntransfer matrix renormalization group (TMRG) technique is applied to explore\nthe thermodynamic properties. The local magnetic moments, spin correlation\nfunctions, and static structure factors are discussed in the ground state for\nthe three cases. It is shown that the static structure factor S(q) shows peaks\nat wavevectors $q=a\\pi /3$ (a=0,1,2,3,4,5) for different couplings in a zero\nmagnetic field, which, however in the magnetic fields where the magnetization\nplateau with m=1/6 pertains, exhibits the peaks only at q=0, $2\\pi /3$ and\n$4\\pi /3$, which are found to be couplings-independent. The DMRG results of the\nzero-field static structure factor can be nicely fitted by a linear\nsuperposition of six modes, where two fitting equations are proposed. It is\nobserved that the six modes are closely related to the low-lying excitations of\nthe system. At finite temperatures, the double-peak structures of the\nsusceptibility and specific heat against temperature are obtained, where the\npeak positions and heights are found to depend on the competition of the\ncouplings. It is also uncovered that the XXZ anisotropy of F and AF couplings\nleads the system of case (c) to display quite different behaviors. In addition,\nthe experimental data of the susceptibility, specific heat and magnetization\nfor the compound Cu$_{3}$(CO$_{3}$)$_{2}$(OH)$_{2}$ are fairly compared with\nour TMRG results.\n",

        "abstract": "  The extraction of a physical law y=yo(x) from joint experimental data about x\nand y is treated. The joint, the marginal and the conditional probability\ndensity functions (PDF) are expressed by given data over an estimator whose\nkernel is the instrument scattering function. As an optimal estimator of yo(x)\nthe conditional average is proposed. The analysis of its properties is based\nupon a new definition of prediction quality. The joint experimental information\nand the redundancy of joint measurements are expressed by the relative entropy.\nWith the number of experiments the redundancy on average increases, while the\nexperimental information converges to a certain limit value. The difference\nbetween this limit value and the experimental information at a finite number of\ndata represents the discrepancy between the experimentally determined and the\ntrue properties of the phenomenon. The sum of the discrepancy measure and the\nredundancy is utilized as a cost function. By its minimum a reasonable number\nof data for the extraction of the law yo(x) is specified. The mutual\ninformation is defined by the marginal and the conditional PDFs of the\nvariables. The ratio between mutual information and marginal information is\nused to indicate which variable is the independent one. The properties of the\nintroduced statistics are demonstrated on deterministically and randomly\nrelated variables.\n",

At low temperature the\nphotoemission spectra are strongly modified, with large band renormalisations\nat high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone and a very large transfer of\nspectral weight to backfolded bands. A theoretical calculation of the spectral\nfunction for an excitonic insulator phase reproduces the experimental features\nwith very good agreement. This gives strong evidence in favour of the excitonic\ninsulator scenario as a driving force for the charge-density wave transition in\n1\\textit{T}-TiSe$_{2}$.\n",

In this scenario,\nthe fresh oxygen released during massive supernova explosions is confined\nwithin the hot superbubbles as long as supernovae continue to explode. Only\nafter the last massive supernova explosion, the metal-rich gas starts cooling\ndown and falls on the galaxy within metal-rich droplets. Full mixing of these\nmetal-rich droplets and the ISM occurs during photoionization by the next\ngenerations of massive stars. During this process, the metal-rich droplets give\nrise to strong recombination lines of the metals, leading to the observed\nORL-CEL discrepancy.

The redundancy is expressed by the\nentropy of information pertaining to the probability density function of\nexperimental variables. Since the calculation of entropy is inconvenient due to\nintegration over a range of variables, an approximate expression for redundancy\nis derived that includes only a sum over the set of experimental data about\nthese variables. The approximation makes feasible an efficient estimation of\nthe redundancy of data along with the related experimental information and\ninformation cost function. From the experimental information the complexity of\nthe phenomenon can be simply estimated, while the proper number of experiments\nneeded for its exploration can be determined from the minimum of the cost\nfunction. The performance of the approximate estimation of these statistics is\ndemonstrated on two-dimensional normally distributed random data.\n",

For complex alloys like\nquasicrystals, however, realistic effective potentials are practically\ninexistent. We report here on our efforts to develop effective potentials\nespecially for quasicrystalline alloy systems. We use the so-called force\nmatching method, in which the potential parameters are adapted so as to\noptimally reproduce the forces and energies in a set of suitably chosen\nreference configurations. These reference data are calculated with ab-initio\nmethods. As a first application, EAM potentials for decagonal Al-Ni-Co,\nicosahedral Ca-Cd, and both icosahedral and decagonal Mg-Zn quasicrystals have\nbeen constructed. The influence of the potential range and degree of\nspecialisation on the accuracy and other properties is discussed and compared.\n",

The implications for the synchrotron emission of\nrelativistic jets, such as those in gamma ray burst sources and blazars, are\ndiscussed.\n",

We find a mass dependent, 1/r^7 correction to the Newtonian potential,\nand also deviations from the Einstein gravity prediction for light-bending. We\nconstrain the parameters of the theory using planetary orbits, the Cassini\nspacecraft data, and a laboratory test of Newton's law, always finding\nextremely tight bounds on the energy associated to the Gauss-Bonnet term. We\ndiscuss the relevance of these constraints to late-time cosmological\nacceleration.\n",

        "abstract": "  Although the Gauss-Bonnet term is a topological invariant for general\nrelativity, it couples naturally to a quintessence scalar field, modifying\ngravity at solar system scales. We determine the solar system constraints due\nto this term by evaluating the post-Newtonian metric for a distributional\nsource. We find a mass dependent, 1/r^7 correction to the Newtonian potential,\nand also deviations from the Einstein gravity prediction for light-bending. We\nconstrain the parameters of the theory using planetary orbits, the Cassini\nspacecraft data, and a laboratory test of Newton's law, always finding\nextremely tight bounds on the energy associated to the Gauss-Bonnet term. We\ndiscuss the relevance of these constraints to late-time cosmological\nacceleration.\n",

        "abstract": "  The electronic transport properties and switching mechanism of single\nphotochromic diarylethene derivatives sandwiched between two gold surfaces with\nclosed and open configurations are investigated by a fully self-consistent\nnonequilibrium Green's function method combined with density functional theory.\nThe calculated transmission spectra of two configurations are strikingly\ndistinctive. The open form lacks any significant transmission peak within a\nwide energy window, while the closed structure has two significant transmission\npeaks on the both sides of the Fermi level. The electronic transport properties\nof the molecular junction with closed structure under a small bias voltage are\nmainly determined by the tail of the transmission peak contributed unusually by\nthe perturbed lowest perturbed unoccupied molecular orbital. The calculated\non-off ratio of currents between the closed and open configurations is about\ntwo orders of magnitude, which reproduces the essential features of the\nexperimental measured results. Moreover, we find that the switching behavior\nwithin a wide bias voltage window is extremely robust to both substituting F or\nS for H or O and varying end anchoring atoms from S to Se and Te.\n",

Using the magnetic coupling\nbetween the ferromagnetic Co layer and the antiferromagnetic FeMn layer we are\nable to produce magnetic domains with two different crystallographic\norientations of the magnetic easy axis within the same sample at the same time.\nWe find a huge difference in the XMLD contrast between the two types of\nmagnetic domains, which we discuss in terms of intrinsic magneto-crystalline\nanisotropy of XMLD of the Co layer. We also demonstrate that due to the high\nsensitivity of the method, the small number of induced ferromagnetic Fe moments\nat the FeMn-Co interface is sufficient to obtain magnetic contrast from XMLD in\na metallic system.\n",

We observed that (10,10) tube can sustain its\nstructural stability for the strain values of 0.23 in elongation and 0.06 in\ncompression at 300K. Bond breaking strain value decreases with increasing\ntemperature under streching but not under compression. The elastic limit,\nYoung's modulus, tensile strength and Poisson ratio are calculated as 0.10,\n0.395 TPa, 83.23 GPa, 0.285, respectively, at 300K. In the temperature range\nfrom 300K to 900K; Young's modulus and the tensile strengths are decreasing\nwith increasing temperature while the Poisson ratio is increasing. At higher\ntemperatures, Young's modulus starts to increase while the Poisson ratio and\ntensile strength decrease. In the temperature range from 1200K to 1800K, the\nSWCNT is already deformed and softened. Applying strain on these deformed and\nsoftened SWCNTs do not follow the same pattern as in the temperature range of\n300K to 900K.\n",

        "abstract": "  We report the discovery of 14 quasars in the vicinity of HE2347-4342, one of\nthe two quasars whose intergalactic HeII forest has been resolved with FUSE. By\nanalysing the HI and the HeII opacity variations separately, no transverse\nproximity effect is detected near three foreground quasars of HE2347-4342:\nQSOJ23503-4328 (z=2.282, $\\vartheta=3.59$ arcmin), QSOJ23500-4319 (z=2.302,\n$\\vartheta=8.77$ arcmin) and QSOJ23495-4338 (z=2.690, $\\vartheta=16.28$\narcmin). This is primarily due to line contamination and overdensities probably\ncreated by large-scale structure. By comparing the HI absorption and the\ncorresponding HeII absorption, we estimated the fluctuating spectral shape of\nthe extragalactic UV radiation field along this line of sight. We find that the\nUV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the three\nforeground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV background\nmodels dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metal\nline systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraints\non the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasars\nshow a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening of\nthe UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.\nThus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also in\noverdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.\nFurthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiative\ntransfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observed\nspectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect of\nQSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.\n",

        "abstract": "  We present a Spitzer based census of the IC 348 nebula and embedded star\ncluster. Our Spitzer census supplemented by ground based spectra has added 42\nclass II T-Tauri sources to the cluster membership and identified ~20 class 0/I\nprotostars. The population of IC 348 likely exceeds 400 sources after\naccounting statistically for unidentified diskless members. Our Spitzer census\nof IC 348 reveals a population of protostars that is anti-correlated spatially\nwith the T-Tauri members, which comprise the centrally condensed cluster around\na B star. The protostars are instead found mostly at the cluster periphery\nabout 1 pc from the B star and spread out along a filamentary ridge. We find\nthat the star formation rate in this protostellar ridge is consistent with that\nrate which built the exposed cluster while the presence of fifteen cold,\nstarless, millimeter cores intermingled with this protostellar population\nindicates that the IC 348 nebula has yet to finish forming stars. We show that\nthe IC 348 cluster is of order 3-5 crossing times old, and, as evidenced by its\nsmooth radial profile and confirmed mass segregation, is likely relaxed. While\nit seems apparent that the current cluster configuration is the result of\ndynamical evolution and its primordial structure has been erased, our findings\nsupport a model where embedded clusters are built up from numerous smaller\nsub-clusters. Finally, the results of our Spitzer census indicate that the\nsupposition that star formation must progress rapidly in a dark cloud should\nnot preclude these observations that show it can be relatively long lived.\n",

A\nJosephson current between two superconducting leads, carried by first-order\ntunnel processes, can be established by non-equilibrium proximity effect. Both\nAndreev and Josephson current is suppressed for bias voltages below a threshold\nset by the Coulomb charging energy. A $\\pi$-transition of the supercurrent can\nbe driven by tuning gate or bias voltages.\n",

We find that the spectrum is well described by a power-law plus\nblackbody model, with photon index Gamma=1.4 and blackbody temperature kT=160\neV. For the estimated distance of 2.5 kpc, this corresponds to a 2-10 keV\nluminosity of about 1.2E+32 erg/s, thus the fraction of the spin-down energy\nchanneled by PSR J1357-6429 into X-ray emission is one of the lowest observed.\nThe Chandra data confirm the positional coincidence with the radio pulsar and\nallow to set an upper limit of 3E+31 erg/s on the 2-10 keV luminosity of a\ncompact pulsar wind nebula. We do not detect any pulsed emission from the\nsource and determine an upper limit of 30% for the modulation amplitude of the\nX-ray emission at the radio frequency of the pulsar.\n",

We present a review of previous results from our {\\it\nChandra} observations, and some preliminary results from new {\\it Chandra} data\nobtained in 2006 and 2007. High resolution imaging and spectroscopic studies of\nSN 1987A with {\\it Chandra} reveal that X-ray emission of SN 1987A originates\nfrom the hot gas heated by interaction of the blast wave with the ring-like\ndense circumstellar medium (CSM) that was produced by the massive progenitor's\nequatorial stellar winds before the SN explosion. The blast wave is now\nsweeping through dense CSM all around the inner ring, and thus SN 1987A is\nrapidly brightening in soft X-rays. At the age of 20 yr (as of 2007 January),\nX-ray luminosity of SN 1987A is $L_{\\rm X}$ $\\sim$ 2.4 $\\times$ 10$^{36}$ ergs\ns$^{-1}$ in the 0.5$-$10 keV band. X-ray emission is described by two-component\nplane shock model with electron temperatures of $kT$ $\\sim$ 0.3 and 2 keV. As\nthe shock front interacts with dense CSM all around the inner ring, the X-ray\nremnant is now expanding at a much slower rate of $v$ $\\sim$ 1400 km s$^{-1}$\nthan it was until 2004 ($v$ $\\sim$ 6000 km s$^{-1}$).\n",

Using X-ray data obtained by XMM, we confirm that the X-ray\nemission from this source is heavily absorbed and has a spectrum best fit by a\npower law model of photon index=2 with no evidence for a thermal component, the\nX-ray emission from G328.4+0.2 comes from a region significantly smaller than\nthe radio emission, and that the X-ray and radio emission are significantly\noffset from each other. We also present the results of a new high resolution (7\narcseconds) 1.4 GHz image of G328.4+0.2 obtained using the Australia Telescope\nCompact Array, and a deep search for radio pulsations using the Parkes Radio\nTelescope. We find that the radio emission has a flat spectrum, though some\nareas along the eastern edge of G328.4+0.2 have a steeper radio spectral index\nof ~-0.3. Additionally, we obtain a luminosity limit of the central pulsar of\nL_{1400} < 30 mJy kpc^2, assuming a distance of 17 kpc. In light of these\nobservational results, we test if G328.4+0.2 is a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) or a\nlarge PWN inside a supernova remnant (SNR) using a simple hydrodynamic model\nfor the evolution of a PWN inside a SNR. As a result of this analysis, we\nconclude that G328.4+0.2 is a young (< 10000 years old) pulsar wind nebula\nformed by a low magnetic field (<10^12 G) neutron star born spinning rapidly\n(<10 ms) expanding into an undetected SNR formed by an energetic (>10^51 ergs),\nlow ejecta mass (M < 5 Solar Masses) supernova explosion which occurred in a\nlow density (n~0.03 cm^{-3}) environment.\n",

Different scenarios can explain this modification including: large\nangle gluon radiation, jets deflected by transverse flow, path length dependent\nenergy loss, Cerenkov gluon radiation of fast moving particles, and conical\nflow generated by hydrodynamic Mach-cone shock-waves. Three-particle\ncorrelations have the power to distinguish the scenarios with conical emission,\nconical flow and Cerenkov radiation, from other scenarios. In addition, the\ndependence of the observed shapes on the $p_T$ of the associated particles can\nbe used to distinguish conical emission from a sonic boom (Mach-cone) and from\nQCD-Cerenkov radiation. We present results from STAR on 3-particle azimuthal\ncorrelations for a high $p_T$ trigger particle with two softer particles.\nResults are shown for $pp$, d+Au and high statistics Au+Au collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV. An important aspect of the analysis is the subtraction\nof combinatorial backgrounds. Systematic uncertainties due to this subtraction\nand the flow harmonics v2 and v4 are investigated in detail. The implications\nof the results for the presence or absence of conical flow from Mach-cones are\ndiscussed.\n",

We explore this\npossibility analizing XMM-Newton observations of the seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3783.\nA detiled time-resolved spectral analysis is performed down to the shortest\npossible time-scales (few ks) using \"excess maps\" and cross-correlating light\ncurves in different energy bands. In addition to a constant core of the Fe K\nalpha line, we detected a variable and redshifted Fe K alpha emission feature\nbetween 5.3-6.1 keV. The line exhibits a modulation on a time-scale of 27 ks\nthat is similar to and in phase with a modulation of the 0.3-10 keV source\ncontinuum. The time-scale of the correlated variability of the redshifted Fe\nline and continuum agrees with the local dynamical time-scale of the accretion\ndisc at 10 r_g around a black hole of 10^7 M_sun. Given the shape of the\nredshfted line emission and the overall X-ray variability pattern, the line is\nlikely to arise from the relativistic region near the black hole.\n",

        "abstract": "  The identification of basaltic asteroids in the asteroid Main Belt and the\ndescription of their surface mineralogy is necessary to understand the\ndiversity in the collection of basaltic meteorites. Basaltic asteroids can be\nidentified from their visible reflectance spectra and are classified as V-type\nin the usual taxonomies. In this work, we report visible spectroscopic\nobservations of two candidate V-type asteroids, (7472) Kumakiri and (10537)\n1991 RY16, located in the outer Main Belt (a > 2.85 UA). These candidate have\nbeen previously identified by Roig and Gil-Hutton (2006, Icarus 183, 411) using\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey colors. The spectroscopic observations have been\nobtained at the Calar Alto Observatory, Spain, during observational runs in\nNovember and December 2006. The spectra of these two asteroids show the steep\nslope shortwards of 0.70 microns and the deep absorption feature longwards of\n0.75 microns that are characteristic of V-type asteroids. However, the presence\nof a shallow but conspicuous absorption band around 0.65 microns opens some\nquestions about the actual mineralogy of these two asteroids. Such band has\nnever been observed before in basaltic asteroids with the intensity we detected\nit. We discuss the possibility for this shallow absorption feature to be caused\nby the presence of chromium on the asteroid surface. Our results indicate that,\ntogether with (1459) Magnya, asteroids (7472) Kumakiri and (10537) 1991 RY16\nmay be the only traces of basaltic material found up to now in the outer Main\nBelt.\n",

        "abstract": "  The extraordinary astrometric accuracy of radio interferometry creates an\nimportant and unique opportunity for the discovery and characterization of\nexo-planets. Currently, the Very Long Baseline Array can routinely achieve\nbetter than 100 microarcsecond accuracy, and can approach 10 microarcsecond\nwith careful calibration. We describe here RIPL, the Radio Interferometric\nPLanet search, a new program with the VLBA and the Green Bank 100 m telescope\nthat will survey 29 low-mass, active stars over 3 years with sub-Jovian planet\nmass sensitivity at 1 AU. An upgrade of the VLBA bandwidth will increase\nastrometric accuracy by an order of magnitude. Ultimately, the colossal\ncollecting area of the Square Kilometer Array could push astrometric accuracy\nto 1 microarcsecond, making detection and characterizaiton of Earth mass\nplanets possible.\n  RIPL and other future radio astrometric planet searches occupy a unique\nvolume in planet discovery and characterization parameter space. The parameter\nspace of astrometric searches gives greater sensitivity to planets at large\nradii than radial velocity searches. For the VLBA and the expanded VLBA, the\ntargets of radio astrometric surveys are by necessity nearby, low-mass, active\nstars, which cannot be studied efficiently through the radial velocity method,\ncoronagraphy, or optical interferometry. For the SKA, detection sensitivity\nwill extend to solar-type stars. Planets discovered through radio astrometric\nmethods will be suitable for characterization through extreme adaptive optics.\n  The complementarity of radio astrometric techniques with other methods\ndemonstrates that radio astrometry can play an important role in the roadmap\nfor exoplanet discovery and characterization.\n",

The study is\nbased on dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) for the infinite dimensional\nHubbard model with antiferromagnetic symmetry breaking. Self-consistent\nsolutions of the DMFT equations are calculated using the numerical\nrenormalization group (NRG). The low energy behavior in these results is then\nanalyzed in terms of renormalized quasiparticles. The parameters for these\nquasiparticles are calculated directly from the NRG derived self-energy, and\nalso from the low energy fixed point of the effective impurity. They are found\nto be in good agreement. We show that the main low energy features of the $\\bf\nk$-resolved spectral density can be understood in terms of the quasiparticle\npicture. We also find that Luttinger's theorem is satisfied for the total\nelectron number in the doped antiferromagnetic state.\n",

We write Maxwell's equations in Schr\\\"odinger form with the\nelectromagnetic propagator playing the role of the Hamiltonian. We prove that\nthe electromagnetic propagator outside of the cloaked objects is essentially\nself-adjoint. Moreover, the unique self-adjoint extension is unitarily\nequivalent to the electromagnetic propagator in the medium\n$\\var_0^{\\lambda\\nu}, \\mu^{\\lambda\\nu}_0$. Using this fact, and since the\ncoordinate transformation is the identity outside of a ball, we prove that the\nscattering operator is the identity. Our results give a rigorous proof that the\nconstruction of \\cite{glu1, glu2, le}, \\cite{pss1} perfectly cloaks passive and\nactive devices from observation by electromagnetic waves. Furthermore, we prove\ncloaking for general anisotropic materials. In particular, our results prove\nthat it is possible to cloak objects inside general crystals.\n",

These properties can also be shown for\nvariational approximations that are generated within the framework of the\nself-energy-functional theory without a truncation of the diagram series.\nLuttinger's sum rule represents an exception. We analyze the conditions under\nwhich the sum rule holds within a non-perturbative conserving approximation.\nNumerical examples are given for a simple but non-trivial dynamical two-site\napproximation. The validity of the sum rule for finite Hubbard clusters and the\nconsequences for cluster extensions of the dynamical mean-field theory are\ndiscussed.\n",

We create realistic\nmock galaxy catalogs by assigning luminosities and colors to dark matter halos\nand subhalos, and we measure the reduced 3PCF as a function of luminosity and\ncolor in both real and redshift space. As galaxy luminosity and color are\nvaried, we find small differences in the amplitude and shape dependence of the\nreduced 3PCF, at a level qualitatively consistent with recent measurements from\nthe SDSS and 2dFGRS. We confirm that discrepancies between previous 3PCF\nmeasurements can be explained in part by differences in binning choices. We\nexplore the degree to which a simple local bias model can fit the simulated\n3PCF. The agreement between the model predictions and galaxy 3PCF measurements\nlends further credence to the straightforward association of galaxies with CDM\nhalos and subhalos.\n",

The observations were made over a\ncontinuous range of wavelengths from 1 - 4um with a high-speed\nspectrophotometer designed expressly for this purpose. We find that the\noccultation fringes cannot be fit by any single-size model. We use the DUSTY\nradiative transfer code to model a circumstellar shell and fit both the\nobserved occultation light curves and the spectral energy distribution\ndescribed in the literature. We find a strong constraint on the inner radius of\nthe dust shell, Tmax = 950 K +/- 50K, and optical depth at 5um of 0.5 +/- 0.1.\nThe observations are best fit by models with a density gradient of r^-2 or the\ngradient derived by Ivezic & Elitzur for a radiatively driven hydrodynamic\noutflow. Our models cannot fit the observed IRAS 60um flux without assuming a\nsubstantial abundance of graphite or by assuming a substantially higher\nmass-loss rate in the past.\n",

        "abstract": "  The usual procedure of including a finite number of vertices in Non\nPerturbative Renormalization Group equations in order to obtain $n$-point\ncorrelation functions at finite momenta is analyzed. This is done by exploiting\na general method recently introduced which includes simultaneously all vertices\nalthough approximating their momentum dependence. The study is performed using\nthe self-energy of the tridimensional scalar model at criticality. At least in\nthis example, low order truncations miss quantities as the critical exponent\n$\\eta$ by as much as 60%. However, if one goes to high order truncations the\nprocedure seems to converge rapidly.\n",

We describe the main\npredictions of a baseline self-stirring model and show how dynamical\nperturbations from a stellar flyby or stirring by a giant planet modify the\nevolution. Although robust comparisons between observations and theory require\nbetter KBO statistics and more comprehensive calculations, the data are broadly\nconsistent with KBO formation in a massive disk followed by substantial\ncollisional grinding and dynamical ejection. However, there are important\nproblems reconciling the results of coagulation and dynamical calculations.\nContrasting our current understanding of the evolution of KBOs and asteroids\nsuggests that additional observational constraints, such as the identification\nof more dynamical families of KBOs (like the 2003 EL61 family), would provide\nadditional information on the relative roles of collisional grinding and\ndynamical ejection in the Kuiper Belt. The uncertainties also motivate\ncalculations that combine collisional and dynamical evolution, a `unified'\ncalculation that should give us a better picture of KBO formation and\nevolution.\n",

        "abstract": "  (Abridged) We compare recent results from X-ray, strong lensing, weak\nlensing, and optical observations with numerical simulations of the merging\ngalaxy cluster 1E0657-56. X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subcluster\nwith a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions of\nthe total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionless\ngalaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies,\nbased on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the\nself-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, using\nsimplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new,\nhigher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of\n1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, and\ncomparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow for\na new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observation\nof an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. This\nnew method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. If\nwe make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equal\nmass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringent\nconstraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of the\nsubcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with the\nuniversal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of dark\nmatter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our limit is a slight\nimprovement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules out\nmost of the 0.5 - 5cm^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between the\nstandard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.\n",

By means of systematic observations of the BL Lac prototype PKS\n2155-304 in the infrared-optical band, we explore variability on the scales of\nmonths, days and hours. We made our observations with the robotic 60 cm\ntelescope REM located at La Silla, Chile. VRIJHK filters were used. PKS\n2155-304 was observed from May to December 2005. The wavelength interval\nexplored, the total number of photometric points and the short integration time\nrender our photometry substantially superior to previous ones for this source.\nOn the basis of the intensity and colour we distinguish three different states\nof the source, each of duration of months, which include all those described in\nthe literature. In particular, we report the highest state ever detected in the\nH band. The source varied by a factor of 4 in this band, much more than in the\nV band (a factor ~2). The source softened with increasing intensity, contrary\nto the general pattern observed in the UV-X-ray bands. On five nights of\nNovember we had nearly continuous monitoring for 2-3 hours. A variability\nepisode with a time scale of ~24 h is well documented, a much more rapid flare\nwith t=1-2 h, is also apparent, but is supported by relatively few points.\n",

Spectral type standard star spectra scaled to the\ndereddened spectrum of A0620-00 in K exceed the A0620-00 spectrum in J and H\nfor all stars of spectral type K7V or earlier, demonstrating that the donor\nstar, unless later than K7V, cannot be the sole NIR flux source in A0620-00. In\naddition, the atomic absorption lines in the K3V spectrum are too weak with\nrespect to those of A0620-00 even at 100% donor star contribution, restricting\nthe spectral type of the donor star in A0620-00 to later than K3V. Comparison\nof the A0620-00 spectrum to scaled K star spectra indicates that the CO\nabsorption features are significantly weaker in A0620-00 than in field dwarf\nstars. Fits of scaled model spectra of a Roche lobe-filling donor star to the\nspectrum of A0620-00 show that the best match to the CO absorption lines is\nobtained when the C abundance is reduced to [C/H] = -1.5. The donor star\ncontribution in the H waveband is determined to be 82+-2%. Combined with\nprevious published results from Froning & Robinson (2001) and Marsh et al.\n(1994), this gives a precise mass for the black hole in A0620-00 of M_BH =\n9.7+-0.6 M_solar.\n",

        "abstract": "  The BL Lac object 3C 66A was observed in an extensive multiwavelength\nmonitoring campaign from July 2003 till April 2004. The spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) was measured over the entire electromagnetic spectrum, with\nflux measurements from radio to X-ray frequencies and upper limits in the very\nhigh energy (VHE) gamma-ray regime. Here, we use a time-dependent leptonic jet\nmodel to reproduce the SED and optical spectral variability observed during our\nmultiwavelength campaign. Our model simulations could successfully reproduce\nthe observed SED and optical light curves and predict an intrinsic cutoff value\nfor the VHE gamma-ray emission at ~ 4 GeV. The effect of the optical depth due\nto the intergalactic infrared background radiation (IIBR) on the peak of the\nhigh-energy component of 3C 66A was found to be negligible. Also, the presence\nof a broad line region (BLR) in the case of 3C 66A may play an important role\nin the emission of gamma-ray photons when the emission region is very close to\nthe central engine, but further out, the production mechanism of hard X-ray and\ngamma-ray photons becomes rapidly dominated by synchrotron self-Compton\nemission. We further discuss the possibility of an observable X-ray spectral\nvariability pattern. The simulated results do not predict observable hysteresis\npatterns in the optical or soft X-ray regimes for major flares on multi-day\ntime scales.\n",

        "abstract": "  Context: How planet properties depend on stellar mass is a key diagnostic of\nplanetary formation mechanisms. Aims: This motivates planet searches around\nstars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and in\nparticular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars.\nMethods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5\ndwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internal\nerrors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersion\nis due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.\nResults: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where each\nplanet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)\nmagnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day period\ncoincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates in\na spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on the\nother hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b. Conclusion: Its detection\nadds to the growing number of Neptune-mass planets around M-dwarfs, and\nreinforces the emerging conclusion that this mass domain is much more populated\nthan the jovian mass range. We discuss the metallicity distributions of M dwarf\nwith and without planets and find a low 11% probability that they are drawn\nfrom the same parent distribution. Moreover, we find tentative evidence that\nthe host star metallicity correlates with the total mass of their planetary\nsystem.\n",

This spectral line is seen here in absorption against\nthe cosmic microwave background, indicating the presence of widespread warm\nmolecular gas at intermediate densities. Overall, the distributions of H$_2$CO\nand CO (taken from the literature) are fairly similar, though significant\ndifferences exist at small scales. Most notably, while the CO peak is nearly\ncoincident with the S140 H${\\alpha}$ arc, the maximum H$_2$CO absorption is\nclearly separated from it by a full 10$'$ beam ($\\sim$ 3 pc). We argue that\nthese differences result from differing abundances and excitation requirements.\nThe CO(1-0) line is more optically thick and more biased towards warm gas than\nthe H$_2$CO 6 cm line. On the other hand, formaldehyde is more easily\nphotodissociated and is, therefore, a poorer tracer of the molecular gas\nlocated immediately behind Photon Dominated Regions.\n",

In this paper, a model consisting\nof two synchrotron emitting shells is presented that reproduces large-scale\nstructures revealed by recent polarization surveys. The polarized emission of\nthe NPS is reproduced by one of these shells. The other shell, which passes\nclose to the Sun, gives rise to polarized emission towards the Galactic poles.\nIt is proposed that X-ray emission seen towards the NPS is produced by\ninteraction of the two shells. Two OB-associations coincide with the centers of\nthe shells. A formation scenario of the Loop I region is suggested.\n",

Our observations show an intriguing picture\nof the interstellar medium; throughout this galaxy velocity-- dispersions range\nbetween 4 to 15 km/sec but are not correlated with star formation, stars or the\ngaseous spiral arms. The velocity dispersions decrease with radius, but this\nglobal trend has a large scatter as there are several isolated, resolved\nregions of high dispersion. The decline of star light with radius is much\nsteeper than that of the velocity dispersions or that of the energy in the gas\nmotions.\n",

        "abstract": "  Common envelopes form in dynamical time scale mass exchange, when the\nenvelope of a donor star engulfs a much denser companion, and the core of the\ndonor plus the dense companion star spiral inward through this dissipative\nenvelope. As conceived by Paczynski and Ostriker, this process must be\nresponsible for the creation of short-period binaries with degenerate\ncomponents, and, indeed, it has proven capable of accounting for short-period\nbinaries containing one white dwarf component. However, attempts to reconstruct\nthe evolutionary histories of close double white dwarfs have proven more\nproblematic, and point to the need for enhanced systemic mass loss, either\nduring the close of the first, slow episode of mass transfer that produced the\nfirst white dwarf, or during the detached phase preceding the final, common\nenvelope episode. The survival of long-period interacting binaries with massive\nwhite dwarfs, such as the recurrent novae T CrB and RS Oph, also presents\ninterpretative difficulties for simple energetic treatments of common envelope\nevolution. Their existence implies that major terms are missing from usual\nformulations of the energy budget for common envelope evolution. The most\nplausible missing energy term is the energy released by recombination in the\ncommon envelope, and, indeed, a simple reformulation the energy budget\nexplicitly including recombination resolves this issue.\n",

We are able\nto pinpoint and understand the reasons for such and other discrepancies when\nthey appear. There is a subtle but important difference in the physics\naddressed in the two models. In particular if we reformulate the parameters in\nthe canonical model to better approximate the physics addressed in the grand\ncanonical model, calculations for observables converge. Next we turn to the\nissue of bimodality in the probability distribution of the largest fragment in\nboth canonical and grand canonical ensembles. We demonstrate that this\ndistribution is very closely related to average multiplicities. The\nrelationship of the bimodal distribution to phase transition is discussed.\n",

Primordial binary frequencies in these\nmodels range from 5% to 50%. Simulations are performed with the NBODY4 code and\ninclude a full mass spectrum of stars, stellar evolution, binary evolution and\nthe tidal field of the Galaxy. We find that the overall binary fraction of a\ncluster almost always remains close to the primordial value, except at late\ntimes when a cluster is near dissolution. A critical exception occurs in the\ncentral regions where we observe a marked increase in binary fraction with time\n-- a simulation starting with 100000 stars and 5% binaries reached a core\nbinary frequency as high as 40% at the end of the core-collapse phase\n(occurring at 16 Gyr with ~20000 stars remaining). Binaries are destroyed in\nthe core by a variety of processes as a cluster evolves, but the combination of\nmass-segregation and creation of new binaries in exchange interactions produces\nthe observed increase in relative number. We also find that binaries are cycled\ninto and out of cluster cores in a manner that is analogous to convection in\nstars. For models of 100000 stars we show that the evolution of the core-radius\nup to the end of the initial phase of core-collapse is not affected by the\nexact value of the primordial binary frequency (for frequencies of 10% or\nless). We discuss the ramifications of our results for the likely primordial\nbinary content of globular clusters.\n",

        "abstract": "  We systematically explore the evolution of the merger of two carbon-oxygen\n(CO) white dwarfs. The dynamical evolution of a 0.9 Msun + 0.6 Msun CO white\ndwarf merger is followed by a three-dimensional SPH simulation. We use an\nelaborate prescription in which artificial viscosity is essentially absent,\nunless a shock is detected, and a much larger number of SPH particles than\nearlier calculations. Based on this simulation, we suggest that the central\nregion of the merger remnant can, once it has reached quasi-static equilibrium,\nbe approximated as a differentially rotating CO star, which consists of a\nslowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounded by a\ncentrifugally supported disc. We construct a model of the CO remnant that\nmimics the results of the SPH simulation using a one-dimensional hydrodynamic\nstellar evolution code and then follow its secular evolution. The stellar\nevolution models indicate that the growth of the cold core is controlled by\nneutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the hot envelope, and\nthat carbon ignition in the envelope can be avoided despite high effective\naccretion rates. This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretion\nof cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of double\nCO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate. Our results imply that\nat least some products of double CO white dwarfs merger may be considered good\ncandidates for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. In this case, the\ncharacteristic time delay between the initial dynamical merger and the eventual\nexplosion would be ~10^5 yr. (Abridged).\n",

        "abstract": "  We present an experimental investigation on the scaling of resistance in\nindividual single walled carbon nanotube devices with channel lengths that vary\nfour orders of magnitude on the same sample. The electron mean free path is\nobtained from the linear scaling of resistance with length at various\ntemperatures. The low temperature mean free path is determined by impurity\nscattering, while at high temperature the mean free path decreases with\nincreasing temperature, indicating that it is limited by electron-phonon\nscattering. An unusually long mean free path at room temperature has been\nexperimentally confirmed. Exponentially increasing resistance with length at\nextremely long length scales suggests anomalous localization effects.\n",

        "abstract": "  Air fluorescence detectors measure the energy of ultra-high energy cosmic\nrays by collecting fluorescence light emitted from nitrogen molecules along the\nextensive air shower cascade. To ensure a reliable energy determination, the\nlight signal needs to be corrected for atmospheric effects, which not only\nattenuate the signal, but also produce a non-negligible background component\ndue to scattered Cherenkov light and multiple-scattered light. The correction\nrequires regular measurements of the aerosol attenuation length and the aerosol\nphase function, defined as the probability of light scattered in a given\ndirection. At the Pierre Auger Observatory in Malargue, Argentina, the phase\nfunction is measured on an hourly basis using two Aerosol Phase Function (APF)\nlight sources. These sources direct a UV light beam across the field of view of\nthe fluorescence detectors; the phase function can be extracted from the image\nof the shots in the fluorescence detector cameras. This paper describes the\ndesign, current status, standard operation procedure, and performance of the\nAPF system at the Pierre Auger Observatory.\n",

        "abstract": "  Close pre-main-sequence binary stars are expected to clear central holes in\ntheir protoplanetary disks, but the extent to which material can flow from the\ncircumbinary disk across the gap onto the individual circumstellar disks has\nbeen unclear. In binaries with eccentric orbits, periodic perturbation of the\nouter disk is predicted to induce mass flow across the gap, resulting in\naccretion that varies with the binary period. This accretion may manifest\nitself observationally as periodic changes in luminosity. Here we present a\nsearch for such periodic accretion in the pre-main-sequence spectroscopic\nbinary UZ Tau E. We present BVRI photometry spanning three years; we find that\nthe brightness of UZ Tau E is clearly periodic, with a best-fit period of 19.16\n+/- 0.04 days. This is consistent with the spectroscopic binary period of 19.13\ndays, refined here from analysis of new and existing radial velocity data. The\nbrightness of UZ Tau E shows significant random variability, but the overall\nperiodic pattern is a broad peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more than\nhalf the binary orbital period. The variability of the H-alpha line is not as\nclearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some periodic component\nis not ruled out. The photometric variations are in good agreement with\npredictions from simulations of binaries with orbital parameters similar to\nthose of UZ Tau E, suggesting that periodic accretion does occur from\ncircumbinary disks, replenishing the inner disks and possibly extending the\ntimescale over which they might form planets.\n",

In this paper, we introduce a new type of\nnetwork growth rule which comprises addition and deletion of nodes, and propose\nan evolving network model to investigate the effect of node deleting on network\nstructure. It is found that, with the introduction of node deleting, network\nstructure is significantly transformed. In particular, degree distribution of\nthe network undergoes a transition from scale-free to exponential forms as the\nintensity of node deleting increases. At the same time, nontrivial\ndisassortative degree correlation develops spontaneously as a natural result of\nnetwork evolution in the model. We also demonstrate that node deleting\nintroduced in the model does not destroy the connectedness of a growing network\nso long as the increasing rate of edges is not excessively small. In addition,\nit is found that node deleting will weaken but not eliminate the small-world\neffect of a growing network, and generally it will decrease the clustering\ncoefficient in a network.\n",

Of them, 15 sources are\nselected from the Parkes Half Jansky (PHJ) sample (Snellen 2002), 4 others are\nfrom our previous observation list. We aimed at imaging the structure of GPS\nsources, searching for Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) and studying the\nabsorption for the convex radio spectra of GPS sources.\n  Results: We obtained total intensity 1.6 GHz VLBI images of 17 sources for\nthe first time. Of them, 80% show mini-double-lobe radio structure, indicating\nthat they are CSOs or candidates, and their host AGNs could be edge-on to us.\nThis result suggests that there is a high incidence of mini double-lobe sources\n(or CSOs) in the PHJ sample. The sources J0323+0534, J1135-0021, J1352+0232,\nJ2058+0540, J2123-0112 and J2325-0344 with measured redshift, showing\ndouble-lobe structure with sizes of <1 kpc, are classified as CSOs.

Paying attention to the small quasi-one-dimensional anisotropy\nof the material, we take an approach from one-dimensional (1D) chains coupled\nwith frustrating zig-zag bonds. By calculating one-particle excitation spectra\nchanging anisotropy parameter $J'/J$ from the decoupled 1D chains to the\nisotropic triangular lattice, we find almost gapless excitations in the wide\nrange from the 1D limit.

The observational simplicity of our approach, and the direct\nmeasurements of the black hole predictor quantity, i.e. the Sersic index, for\nboth elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies makes it\nstraightforward to estimate accurate black hole masses in early- and late-type\ngalaxies alike. We have parameterised the supermassive black hole mass function\nwith a Schechter function and find, at the low-mass end, a logarithmic slope\n(1+alpha) of ~0.7 for the full galaxy sample and ~1.0 for the early-type galaxy\nsample. Considering spheroidal stellar systems brighter than M_B = -18 mag, and\nintegrating down to black hole masses of 10^6 M_sun, we find that the local\nmass density of supermassive black holes in early-type galaxies rho_{bh,\nearly-type} = (3.5+/-1.2) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}, and in late-type\ngalaxies rho_{bh, late-type} = (1.0+/-0.5) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}. The\nuncertainties are derived from Monte Carlo simulations which include\nuncertainties in the M_bh-n relation, the catalogue of Sersic indices, the\ngalaxy weights and Malmquist bias. The combined, cosmological, supermassive\nblack hole mass density is thus Omega_{bh, total} = (3.2+/-1.2) x 10^{-6} h_70.\nThat is, using a new and independent method, we conclude that (0.007+/-0.003)\nh^3_{70} per cent of the universe's baryons are presently locked up in\nsupermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies.\n",

One of the\ninteresting consequences of pion propagation in ANM is the mode splitting for\nthe different charged states of pions. First we describe the pion-nucleon\ndynamics using the non-chiral model where one starts with pseudoscalar (PS)\n$\\pi$N coupling and the pseudovector (PV) representation is obtained via\nsuitable non-linear field transformations. For both of these cases the effect\nof the Dirac sea is estimated. Subsequently, we present results using the\nchiral effective Lagrangian where the short-distance behavior (Dirac vacuum) is\nincluded by re-defining the field parameters as done in the modern effective\nfield theory approach developed recently. The results are compared with the\nprevious calculations for the case of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM). Closed\nform analytical results are presented for the effective pion masses and\ndispersion relations by making hard nucleon loop (HNL) approximation and\nsuitable density expansion.\n",

It is shown that the Kondo effect\nwill decrease the magnitude of the persistent charge and spin currents in this\nside-coupled Anderson impurity case. In the presence of SO coupling, the\npersistent currents change drastically and oscillate with the strength of SO\ncoupling. The SO coupling will suppress the Kondo effect and restore the abrupt\njumps of the persistent currents. It is also found that a persistent spin\ncurrent circulating the ring can exist even without the charge current in this\nsystem.\n",

Harmonic modes are excited by the fluctuating drag\nforce, at different wave-numbers. This simple mechanical probe makes it\npossible to measure excitations of the flow at specific scales, averaged over\nspace and time: it is a scale-resolved, global measurement. We also measure the\ndissipation associated to the string motion, and we consider the ratio of the\nfluctuations over dissipation (FDR). In an exploratory approach, we investigate\nthe concept of {\\it effective temperature} defined through the FDR. We compare\nour observations with other definitions of temperature in turbulence. From the\ntheory of Kolmogorov (1941), we derive the exponent -11/3 expected for the\nspectrum of the fluctuations. This simple model and our experimental results\nare in good agreement, over the range of wave-numbers, and Reynolds number\naccessible ($74000 \\leq Re \\leq 170000$).\n",

This analysis did not require the\nmodification of Newtonian dynamics, but rather only their restatement in a five\ndimensional framework. The same analysis derived a acceleration parameter ar,\nwhich plays an important role in the restated equations of orbital dynamics,\nand suggested a value for ar. In this companion paper, the principle of\nconservation of energy is restated within the same five-dimensional framework.\nThe resulting analysis provides an alternative route to estimating the value of\nar, without reference to the equations of orbital dynamics, and based solely on\nkey cosmological constants and parameters, including the gravitational\nconstant, G. The same analysis suggests that: (i) the inverse square law of\ngravity may itself be due to the conservation of energy at the boundary between\na four-dimensional universe and a fifth large-scale space-time dimension; and\n(ii) there is a limiting case for the Tulley-Fisher relationship linking the\nspeed of light to the mass of the Universe.\n",

Local nano-friction\nexperiments were conducted with the same device in order to determine the\nevolution of the friction coefficient as a function of the applied pressure for\nthe different lubricant formulations. For the MoDTC film, the applied pressure\nin the friction test remains low (<0.5 GPa) and the apparent friction\ncoefficient is high ($\\mu$ > 0.4). For the tribofilms containing MoDTC together\nwith ZDTP, which permits the applied pressure to increase up to a few GPa\nthrough some accommodation process, a very low friction domain appears (0.01 <\n$\\mu$ < 0.05), located a few nanometers below the surface of the tribofilm.\nThis low friction coefficient is attributed to the presence of MoS2 planes\nsliding over each other in a favourable configuration obtained when the\npressure is sufficiently high, which is made possible by the presence of ZDTP.\n",

We present a general master equation governing\nthe dynamics of the translational states of the atom. In the framework of the\nDebye model, we derive compact expressions for the rates for both upward and\ndownward transitions. Numerical calculations for the transition rates are\nperformed for a deep silica-induced potential allowing for a large number of\nbound levels as well as free states of a cesium atom. The total absorption rate\nis shown to be determined mainly by the bound-to-bound transitions for deep\nbound levels and by bound-to-free transitions for shallow bound levels.\nMoreover, the phonon emission and absorption processes can be orders of\nmagnitude larger for deep bound levels as compared to the shallow bound ones.\nWe also study various types of transitions from free states. We show that, for\nthermal atomic cesium with temperature in the range from 100 $\\mu$K to 400\n$\\mu$K in the vicinity of a silica surface with temperature of 300 K, the\nadsorption (free-to-bound decay) rate is about two times larger than the\nheating (free-to-free upward decay) rate, while the cooling (free-to-free\ndownward decay) rate is negligible.\n",

Through the use of a simple\nfunctional form with two free parameters, revealed is that it is indeed\npossible to make networks more robust while spending less cost.

        "abstract": "  A number of giant HII regions are associated with soft diffuse X-ray\nemission. Among these, the Carina nebula possesses the brightest soft diffuse\nemission. The required plasma temperature and thermal energy can be produced by\ncollisions or termination of fast winds from main-sequence or embedded young O\nstars, but the extended emission is often observed from regions apart from\nmassive stellar clusters. The origin of the X-ray emission is unknown.\n  The XIS CCD camera onboard Suzaku has the best spectral resolution for\nextended soft sources so far, and is therefore capable of measuring key\nemission lines in the soft band. Suzaku observed the core and the eastern side\nof the Carina nebula (Car-D1) in 2005 Aug and 2006 June, respectively. Spectra\nof the south part of the core and Car-D1 similarly showed strong L-shell lines\nof iron ions and K-shell lines of silicon ions, while in the north of the core\nthese lines were much weaker. Fitting the spectra with an absorbed thin-thermal\nplasma model showed kT~0.2, 0.6 keV and NH~1-2e21 cm-2 with a factor of 2-3\nabundance variation in oxygen, magnesium, silicon and iron. The plasma might\noriginate from an old supernova, or a super shell of multiple supernovae.\n",

        "abstract": "  We present the results of a visible spectroscopic and photometric survey of\nJupiter Trojans belonging to different dynamical families carried out at the\nESO-NTT telescope. We obtained data on 47 objects, 23 belonging to the L5 swarm\nand 24 to the L4 one. These data together with those already published by\nFornasier et al. (2004a) and Dotto et al. (2006), constitute a total sample of\nvisible spectra for 80 objects. The survey allows us to investigate six\nfamilies (Aneas, Anchises, Misenus, Phereclos, Sarpedon, Panthoos) in the L5\ncloud and four L4 families (Eurybates, Menelaus, 1986 WD and 1986 TS6). The\nsample that we measured is dominated by D--type asteroids, with the exception\nof the Eurybates family in the L4 swarm, where there is a dominance of C- and\nP-type asteroids. All the spectra that we obtained are featureless with the\nexception of some Eurybates members, where a drop--off of the reflectance is\ndetected shortward of 5200 A. Similar features are seen in main belt C-type\nasteroids and commonly attributed to the intervalence charge transfer\ntransition in oxidized iron. Our sample comprises fainter and smaller Trojans\nas compared to the literature's data and allows us to investigate the\nproperties of objects with estimated diameter smaller than 40--50 km. The\nanalysis of the spectral slopes and colors versus the estimated diameters shows\nthat the blue and red objects have indistinguishable size distribution. We\nperform a statistical investigation of the Trojans's spectra property\ndistributions as a function of their orbital and physical parameters, and in\ncomparison with other classes of minor bodies in the outer Solar System.\nTrojans at lower inclination appear significantly bluer than those at higher\ninclination, but this effect is strongly driven by the Eurybates family.\n",

The\nsample was selected to investigate whether objects of this kind could be relics\nof radio-loud AGNs switched off at very early stages of their evolution or\npossibly to indicate intermittent activity. Initial observations were made\nusing MERLIN at 5 GHz. The sources have now been observed with the VLBA at 1.7,\n5 and 8.4 GHz in a snapshot mode with phase-referencing. The resulting maps are\npresented along with unpublished 8.4-GHz VLA images of five sources. Some of\nthe sources discussed here show a complex radio morphology and therefore a\ncomplicated past that, in some cases, might indicate intermittent activity. One\nof the sources studied - 1045+352 - is known as a powerful radio and\ninfrared-luminous broad absorption line (BAL) quasar. It is a young CSS object\nwhose asymmetric two-sided morphology on a scale of several hundred parsecs,\nextending in two different directions, may suggest intermittent activity. The\nyoung age and compact structure of 1045+352 is consistent with the evolution\nscenario of BAL quasars. It has also been confirmed that the submillimetre flux\nof 1045+352 can be seriously contaminated by synchrotron emission.\n",

When the potential of the scalar field is exponential and\nunbounded from below, the general solution of the Einstein equations has\nquasi-isotropic asymptotics near the singularity instead of the usual\nanisotropic Belinskii - Khalatnikov - Lifshitz (BKL) asymptotics. Depending on\nthe strength of scalar field potential, there exist two phases of quantum\ngravity with scalar field: one with essentially anisotropic behavior of field\ncorrelation functions near the cosmological singularity, and another with\nquasi-isotropic behavior. The ``phase transition'' between the two phases is\ninterpreted as the condensation of gravitons.\n",

        "abstract": "  The status of 38 halo white dwarf candidates identified by Oppenheimer et al.\n(2001) has been intensively discussed by various authors. In analyses\nundertaken to date, trigonometric parallaxes are crucial missing data. Distance\nmeasurements are mandatory to kinematically segregate halo object from disk\nobjects and hence enable a more reliable estimate of the local density of halo\ndark matter residing in such objects.\n  We present trigonometric parallax measurements for 15 candidate halo white\ndwarfs (WDs) selected from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. We observed the\nstars using the ESO 1.56-m Danish Telescope and ESO 2.2-m telescope from August\n2001 to July 2004. Parallaxes with accuracies of 1--2 mas were determined\nyielding relative errors on distances of $\\sim5$% for 6 objects, $\\sim12$% for\n3 objects, and $\\sim20$% for two more objects. Four stars appear to be too\ndistant (probably farther than 100 pc) to have measurable parallaxes in our\nobservations. Distances, absolute magnitudes and revised space velocities were\nderived for the 15 halo WDs from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. Halo\nmembership is confirmed unambiguously for 6 objects while 5 objects may be\nthick disk members and 4 objects are too distant to draw any conclusion based\nsolely on kinematics. Comparing our trigonometric parallaxes with photometric\nparallaxes used in previous work reveals an overestimation of distance as\nderived from photometric techniques. This new data set can be used to revise\nthe halo white dwarf space density, and that analysis will be presented in a\nsubsequent publication.\n",

This may have implications\nfor gravitational wave astronomy in high-frequency sources such as core\ncollapse supernovae. In this paper we present high-resolution simulations,\nperformed with an adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamics code, of such low\nT/|W| bar-mode instability. The complex morphological features involved in the\nnonlinear dynamics of the instability are revealed in our simulations, which\nshow that the excitation of Kelvin-Helmholtz-like fluid modes outside the\ncorotation radius of the star leads to the saturation of the bar-mode\ndeformation. While the overall trends reported in an earlier investigation are\nconfirmed by our work, we also find that numerical resolution plays an\nimportant role during the long-term, nonlinear behaviour of the instability,\nwhich has implications on the dynamics of rotating stars and on the attainable\namplitudes of the associated gravitational wave signals.\n",

These analytical results are\nverified by numerical solutions, which are valid for a wide range of\ninhomogeneity strength. It is shown that the inhomogeneous mass density field\nleads to the reduction of a wave frequency of torsional oscillations, in\ncomparison to that of estimated from mass density at the loop apex. This\nfrequency reduction results from the decrease of an average Alfven speed as far\nas the inhomogeneous loop is denser at its footpoints. The derived dispersion\nrelations and wave profiles are important for potential observations of\ntorsional oscillations which result in periodic variations of spectral line\nwidths. Torsional oscillations offer an additional powerful tool for a\ndevelopment of coronal seismology.\n",

Above the metal-insulator\ntransition related to the anion ordering the optical conductivity spectra show\na Drude-like response. Below the transition an energy gap of about 1500 cm-1\n(185 meV) opens, leading to the corresponding charge transfer band in the\noptical conductivity spectra. The analysis of the infrared-active vibrations\ngives evidence for the long-range crystal structure modulation below the\ntransition temperature and for the short-range order fluctuations of the\nlattice modulation above the transition temperature. Also we report about a new\ninfrared mode at around 710 cm-1 with a peculiar temperature behavior, which\nhas so far not been observed in any other (TMTSF)2X salt showing a\nmetal-insulator transition. A qualitative model based on the coupling between\nthe TMTSF molecule vibration and the reorientation of electrical dipole moment\nof the FSO3 anion is proposed, in order to explain the anomalous behavior of\nthe new mode.\n",

We report transport and microwave power measurements\non specially designed nanopillars for which a non-standard angular dependence\nof the spin transfer torque (wavy variation) is predicted by theoretical\nmodels. We observe a new kind of current-induced dynamics that is characterized\nby large angle precessions in the absence of any applied field, as this is also\npredicted by simulation with such a wavy angular dependence of the torque. This\ntype of non-standard nanopillars can represent an interesting way for the\nimplementation of spin transfer oscillators since they are able to generate\nmicrowave oscillations without applied magnetic field. We also emphasize the\ntheoretical implications of our results on the angular dependence of the\ntorque.\n",

Consequently one always generalizes the\nCartesian prescription to other coordinates and falls in a trap. In this work\nwe introduce the difficulties one faces when the question of the momentum\noperator in spherical polar coordinate comes. We have tried to point out most\nof the elementary quantum mechanical results, related to the momentum operator,\nwhich has coordinate dependence. We explicitly calculate the momentum\nexpectation values in various bound states and show that the expectation value\nreally turns out to be zero, a consequence of the fact that the momentum\nexpectation value is real. We comment briefly on the status of the angular\nvariables in quantum mechanics and the problems related in interpreting them as\ndynamical variables. At the end, we calculate the Heisenberg's equation of\nmotion for the radial component of the momentum for the Hydrogen atom.\n",

The gases of the three flames contain 20.9% (molar) of methane\nand 33.4% of oxygen, corresponding to an equivalence ratio of 1.25 for the pure\nmethane flame. In both doped flames, 2.49% of C3H4 was added, corresponding to\na ratio C3H4/CH4 of 12% and an equivalence ratio of 1.55. The three flames have\nbeen stabilized on a burner at a pressure of 6.7 kPa using argon as dilutant,\nwith a gas velocity at the burner of 36 cm/s at 333 K. The concentration\nprofiles of stable species were measured by gas chromatography after sampling\nwith a quartz microprobe. Quantified species included carbon monoxide and\ndioxide, methane, oxygen, hydrogen, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, propyne,\nallene, propene, propane, 1,2-butadiene, 1,3-butadiene, 1-butene, isobutene,\n1-butyne, vinylacetylene, and benzene. The temperature was measured using a\nPtRh (6%)-PtRh (30%) thermocouple settled inside the enclosure and ranged from\n700 K close to the burner up to 1850 K. In order to model these new results,\nsome improvements have been made to a mechanism previously developed in our\nlaboratory for the reactions of C3-C4 unsaturated hydrocarbons. The main\nreaction pathways of consumption of allene and propyne and of formation of C6\naromatic species have been derived from flow rate analyses.\n",

        "abstract": "  We study the performance of holonomic quantum gates, driven by lasers, under\nthe effect of a dissipative environment modeled as a thermal bath of\noscillators. We show how to enhance the performance of the gates by suitable\nchoice of the loop in the manifold of the controllable parameters of the laser.\nFor a simplified, albeit realistic model, we find the surprising result that\nfor a long time evolution the performance of the gate (properly estimated in\nterms of average fidelity) increases. On the basis of this result, we compare\nholonomic gates with the so-called stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP)\ngates.\n",

To give an example we compute\nhere the imaginary part of the magnetic moment for the cases of the muon and\nthe neutron at leading order in the electroweak coupling. We also consider an\nanalogous effect for the strongly-decaying $\\Delta$(1232) resonance. The result\nfor the muon is Im$ \\mu = e G_F^2 m^3/768 \\pi^3$, with $e$ the charge and $m$\nthe mass of the muon, $G_F$ the Fermi constant, which in an external magnetic\nfield of $B$ Tesla give rise to the relative change in the muon lifetime of\n$3\\times 10^{-15} B$. For neutron the effect is of a similar magnitude. We\nspeculate on the observable implications of this effect.\n",

Individual\nmeasurements of the spins of the particles are performed in transverse\ndirections, giving access to the relative phase of the condensates. Initially,\nthis phase is completely undefined, and the first measurements provide random\nresults. But a fixed value of this phase rapidly emerges under the effect of\nthe successive quantum measurements, giving rise to a quasi-classical situation\nwhere all spins have parallel transverse orientations. If the number of\nmeasurements reaches its maximum (the number of particles), quantum effects\nshow up again, giving rise to violations of Bell type inequalities. The\nviolation of BCHSH inequalities with an arbitrarily large number of spins may\nbe comparable (or even equal) to that obtained with two spins.\n",

        "abstract": "  We analyze the effect of gravitational radiation reaction on generic orbits\naround a body with an axisymmetric mass quadrupole moment Q to linear order in\nQ, to the leading post-Newtonian order, and to linear order in the mass ratio.\nThis system admits three constants of the motion in absence of radiation\nreaction: energy, angular momentum, and a third constant analogous to the\nCarter constant. We compute instantaneous and time-averaged rates of change of\nthese three constants. For a point particle orbiting a black hole, Ryan has\ncomputed the leading order evolution of the orbit's Carter constant, which is\nlinear in the spin. Our result, when combined with an interaction quadratic in\nthe spin (the coupling of the black hole's spin to its own radiation reaction\nfield), gives the next to leading order evolution. The effect of the\nquadrupole, like that of the linear spin term, is to circularize eccentric\norbits and to drive the orbital plane towards antialignment with the symmetry\naxis. In addition we consider a system of two point masses where one body has a\nsingle mass multipole or current multipole. To linear order in the mass ratio,\nto linear order in the multipole, and to the leading post-Newtonian order, we\nshow that there does not exist an analog of the Carter constant for such a\nsystem (except for the cases of spin and mass quadrupole). With mild additional\nassumptions, this result falsifies the conjecture that all vacuum, axisymmetric\nspacetimes posess a third constant of geodesic motion.\n",

        "abstract": "  Structure entails function and thus a structural description of the brain\nwill help to understand its function and may provide insights into many\nproperties of brain systems, from their robustness and recovery from damage, to\ntheir dynamics and even their evolution. Advances in the analysis of complex\nnetworks provide useful new approaches to understanding structural and\nfunctional properties of brain networks. Structural properties of networks\nrecently described allow their characterization as small-world, random\n(exponential) and scale-free. They complement the set of other properties that\nhave been explored in the context of brain connectivity, such as topology,\nhodology, clustering, and hierarchical organization. Here we apply new network\nanalysis methods to cortical inter-areal connectivity networks for the cat and\nmacaque brains. We compare these corticocortical fibre networks to benchmark\nrewired, small-world, scale-free and random networks, using two analysis\nstrategies, in which we measure the effects of the removal of nodes and\nconnections on the structural properties of the cortical networks. The brain\nnetworks' structural decay is in most respects similar to that of scale-free\nnetworks. The results implicate highly connected hub-nodes and bottleneck\nconnections as structural basis for some of the conditional robustness of brain\nsystems. This informs the understanding of the development of brain networks'\nconnectivity.\n",

New applications exploiting the quantum\nproperties of light require sources for which either individual photons, or\npairs, are generated in a regulated stream. Here we review recent research on\nsingle-photon sources based on the emission of a single semiconductor quantum\ndot. In just a few years remarkable progress has been made in generating\nindistinguishable single-photons and entangled photon pairs using such\nstructures. It suggests it may be possible to realise compact, robust, LED-like\nsemiconductor devices for quantum light generation.\n",

In agreement\nwith previous predictions, we find that the radiation can lead to large\nenhancements of the conductance of such contacts by bringing off-resonant\nlevels into resonance through photoassisted processes. In our analysis we make\nuse of the simplifying fact that, under certain assumptions, the\nphotoconductance can be expressed in terms of the transmission function in the\nabsence of the radiation. The conductance enhancement is demonstrated for\noligophenylene molecules between gold electrodes, whose electronic structure is\ncalculated based on density-functional theory. It is shown that the exponential\ndecay of the conductance with the length of the molecule can be replaced by a\nlength-independent value in the presence of radiation.\n",

Non-equilibrium Green function calculations show that nano-ribbon\njunctions tailored from single layer graphene with different edge shape and\nwidth can act as metal-semiconductor junctions and quantum dots can be\nimplemented. In virtue of the possibilities of patterning monolayer graphene\ndown to atomic precision, these structures, quite different from the previously\nreported two-dimensional bulk graphene or carbon nanotube devices, are expected\nto be used as the building blocks of the future nano-electronics.\n",

Our simulation results have demonstrated that both central\ncollisions of the two extreme orientations can achieve full stopping, and also\nform a bulk of hot, dense nuclear matter with a sufficiently large volume and\nlong duration, due to the largely deformed uranium nuclei. The nucleon sideward\nflow in the tip-tip collisions is nearly 3 times larger than that in body-body\nones at normalized impact parameter $b/b_{max}<0.5$, and that the body-body\ncentral collisions have a largest negative nucleon elliptic flow $v_{2}=-12%$\nin contrast to zero in tip-tip ones. Thus the extreme circumstance and the\nnovel experimental observables in tip-tip and body-body collisions can provide\na good condition and sensitive probe to study the nuclear EoS, respectively.\nThe Cooling Storage Ring (CSR) External Target Facility (ETF) to be built at\nLanzhou, China, delivering the uranium beam up to 520 MeV/nucleon is expected\nto make significant contribution to explore the nuclear equation of state\n(EoS).\n",

We estimate the\nimpact of this flux on the formation of molecular hydrogen and cooling in the\nfirst galaxies, assuming different types of radiation sources (e.g. Pop II and\nPop III stars, miniquasars). We find that H- photodissociation reduces the\nformation of H2 molecules by a factor of ~1+1000k_s*x/(f_esc*delta), where x is\nthe mean ionized fraction in the IGM, f_esc is the fraction of ionizing photons\nthat escape from their progenitor halos, delta is the local gas overdensity and\nk_s is an order unity constant which depends on the type of radiation source.\nBy the time a significant fraction of the universe becomes ionized, H-\nphotodissociation may significantly reduce the H2 abundance and, with it, the\nprimordial star formation rate, delaying the progress of reionization.\n",

By a finite-size scaling analysis of Monte Carlo\nsimulations at various values of $p$ in the region $p_N<p<1$, we provide strong\nnumerical evidence that the critical behavior along the ferromagnetic\ntransition line belongs to the same universality class as the three-dimensional\nrandomly-dilute Ising model. We obtain the results $\\nu=0.682(3)$ and\n$\\eta=0.036(2)$ for the critical exponents, which are consistent with the\nestimates $\\nu=0.683(2)$ and $\\eta=0.036(1)$ at the transition of\nrandomly-dilute Ising models.\n",

We detect and confirm the protostellar\nstatus for the near-infrared source CB54YC1-II. The mid-infrared luminosity for\nCB54YC1-II was found to be $L_{midir} \\approx 8 L_\\sun$, and we estimate a\ncentral source mass of $M_* \\approx 0.8 M_\\sun$ (for a mass accretion rate of\n${\\dot M}=10^{-6} M_\\sun yr^{-1}$). CB54 harbors another near-infrared source\n(CB54YC1-I), which was not detected by our observations. The non-detection is\nconsistent with CB54YC1-I being a highly extinguished embedded young A or B\nstar or a background G or F giant. An alternative explanation for CB54YC1-I is\nthat the source is an embedded protostar viewed at an extremely high\ninclination angle, and the near-infrared detections are not of the central\nprotostar, but of light scattered by the accretion disk into our line of sight.\nIn addition, we have discovered three new mid-infrared sources, which are\nspatially coincident with the previously known dense core in CB54. The source\ntemperatures ($\\sim100$K) and association of the mid-infrared sources with the\ndense core suggests that these mid-infrared objects may be embedded class 0\nprotostars.\n",

This applies also to stationary spacetimes if additional\nconditions are fulfilled, as for most known black hole/ring solutions. (The\nconclusions change when the Killing generator becomes null, such as at Killing\nhorizons.) Next we demonstrate that the same Weyl types characterize warped\nproduct spacetimes with a one-dimensional Lorentzian (timelike) factor, whereas\nwarped spacetimes with a two-dimensional Lorentzian factor are restricted to\nthe types D or O. By exploring the Bianchi identities, we then analyze the\nsimplest non-trivial case from the above classes - type D vacuum spacetimes,\npossibly with a cosmological constant, dropping, however, the assumptions that\nthe spacetime is static, stationary or warped. It is shown that for ``generic''\ntype D vacuum spacetimes the corresponding principal null directions are\ngeodetic in any dimension (this applies also to type II spacetimes). For n>=5,\nhowever, there may exist particular cases of type D spacetimes which admit\nnon-geodetic multiple principal null directions and we present such examples in\nany n>=7. Further studies are restricted to five dimensions, where the type D\nWeyl tensor is described by a 3x3 matrix \\Phi_{ij}. In the case with\n``twistfree'' (A_{ij}=0) principal null geodesics we show that in a ``generic''\ncase \\Phi_{ij} is symmetric and eigenvectors of \\Phi_{ij} coincide with those\nof the expansion matrix S_{ij}, providing us with three preferred spacelike\ndirections of the spacetime. Similar results are also obtained when relaxing\nthe twistfree condition and assuming instead that \\Phi_{ij} is symmetric. The\nn=5 Myers-Perry black hole and Kerr-NUT-AdS metrics in arbitrary dimension are\nbriefly studied as specific examples of type D vacuum spacetime.\n",

        "abstract": "  We report evidence for a planetary companion around the nearby young star HD\n70573. The star is a G type dwarf located at a distance of 46 pc with age\nestimation between 20 and 300 Myrs. We carried out spectroscopic observations\nof this star with FEROS at the 2.2 m MPG/ESO telescope at La Silla. Our\nspectroscopic analysis yields a spectral type of G1-1.5V and an age of about\n100 Myrs. Variations in stellar radial velocity of HD 70573 have been monitored\nsince December 2003 until January 2007. The velocity accuracy of FEROS within\nthis period is about 10 m/s. HD 70573 shows a radial velocity variation with a\nperiod of 852 +/- 12 days and a semi-amplitude of 149 +/- 6 m/s. The period of\nthis variation is significantly longer than its rotational period, which is 3.3\ndays. Based on the analysis of the Ca II K emission line, Halpha and Teff\nvariation as stellar activity indicators as well as the lack of a correlation\nbetween the bisector velocity span and the radial velocity, we can exclude the\nrotational modulation and non-radial pulsations as the source of the\nlong-period radial velocity variation. Thus, the presence of a low-mass\ncompanion around the star provides the best explanation for the observed radial\nvelocity variation. Assuming a primary mass m1=1.0 +/- 0.1 Msun for the host\nstar, we calculated a minimum mass of the companion m2sini of 6.1 Mjup, which\nlies in the planetary mass regime, and an orbital semi-major axis of 1.76 AU.\nThe orbit of the planet has an eccentricity of e=0.4. The planet discovery\naround the young star HD 70573 gives an important input for the study of debris\ndisks around young stars and their relation to the presence of planets.\n",

        "abstract": "  Many extra-solar planets discovered over the past decade are gas giants in\ntight orbits around their host stars. Due to the difficulties of forming these\n`hot Jupiters' in situ, they are generally assumed to have migrated to their\npresent orbits through interactions with their nascent discs. In this paper, we\npresent a systematic study of giant planet migration in power law discs. We\nfind that the planetary migration rate is proportional to the disc surface\ndensity. This is inconsistent with the assumption that the migration rate is\nsimply the viscous drift speed of the disc. However, this result can be\nobtained by balancing the angular momentum of the planet with the viscous\ntorque in the disc. We have verified that this result is not affected by\nadjusting the resolution of the grid, the smoothing length used, or the time at\nwhich the planet is released to migrate.\n",

Numerous absorption lines were detected in the HETGS spectrum.\nThe lines are associated with highly ionized Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, and Fe,\nsome of which have been seen in earlier HETGS observations. Surprisingly,\nhowever, we discovered dramatic variability of the lines over the duration of\nthe present observation. For instance, the flux of the Ne X line at 12.14 \\AA\\\nwas about $5 \\times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the early part of\nthe observation but became subsequently undetectable, with a 99% upper limit of\n$0.06 \\times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ on the flux of the line. This\nimplies that the line weakened by nearly two orders of magnitude on a timescale\nof hours. The overall X-ray flux of the source did also vary during the\nobservation but only by 20--30%. For Cyg X-1, the absorption lines are\ngenerally attributed to the absorption of X-rays by ionized stellar wind in the\nbinary system. Therefore, they may provide valuable diagnostics on the physical\ncondition of the wind. We discuss the implications of the results.\n",

        "abstract": "  A space-based gravitational microlensing exoplanet survey will provide a\nstatistical census of exoplanets with masses down to 0.1 Earth-masses and\norbital separations ranging from 0.5AU to infinity. This includes analogs to\nall the Solar System's planets except for Mercury, as well as most types of\nplanets predicted by planet formation theories. Such a survey will provide\nresults on the frequency of planets around all types of stars except those with\nshort lifetimes. Close-in planets with separations < 0.5 AU are invisible to a\nspace-based microlensing survey, but these can be found by Kepler. Other\nmethods, including ground-based microlensing, cannot approach the comprehensive\nstatistics on the mass and semi-major axis distribution of extrasolar planets\nthat a space-based microlensing survey will provide. The terrestrial planet\nsensitivity of a ground-based microlensing survey is limited to the vicinity of\nthe Einstein radius at 2-3 AU, and space-based imaging is needed to identify\nand determine the mass of the planetary host stars for the vast majority of\nplanets discovered by microlensing. Thus, a space-based microlensing survey is\nlikely to be the only way to gain a comprehensive understanding of the nature\nof planetary systems, which is needed to understand planet formation and\nhabitability. The proposed Microlensing Planet Finder (MPF) mission is an\nexample of a space-based microlensing survey that can accomplish these\nobjectives with proven technology and a cost that fits comfortably under the\nNASA Discovery Program cost cap.\n",

We conclude\nthat both components are young, comoving members of the association; we also\npresent high-resolution observations which show that the primary is itself a\nclose binary system. If the Aab and B components are gravitationally bound, the\nsystem would fall into the small class of young multiple systems which have\nunusually wide separations as compared to field systems of similar mass.\nHowever, we demonstrate that physical association can not be assumed purely on\nprobabilistic grounds for any individual candidate system in this separation\nrange. Analysis of the association's two-point correlation function shows that\nthere is a significant probability (25%) that at least one pair of low-mass\nassociation members will be separated in projection by <15\", so analysis of the\nwide binary population in Upper Sco will require a systematic search for all\nwide systems; the detection of another such pair would represent an excess at\nthe 98% confidence level.\n",

We show that the magnitudes of\nthese RMs oscillate with longitude in a manner that correlates with the\nlocations of the Galactic spiral arms. The observed pattern in RMs requries the\npresence of at least one large-scale magnetic reversal in the fourth Galactic\nquadrant, located between the Sagittarius- Carina and Scutum-Crux spiral arms.\nTo quantitatively compare our measurements to other recent studies, we consider\nall available extragalactic and pulsar RMs in the region we have surveyed, and\njointly fit these data to simple models in which the large-scale field follows\nthe spiral arms. In the best-fitting model, the magnetic field in the fourth\nGalactic quadrant is directed clockwise in the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm\n(as viewed from the North Galactic pole), but is oriented counter- clockwise in\nthe Scutum-Crux arm. This contrasts with recent analyses of pulsar RMs alone,\nin which the fourth-quadrant field was presumed to be directed\ncounter-clockwise in the Sagittarius- Carina arm. Also in contrast to recent\npulsar RM studies, our joint modeling of pulsar and extragalactic RMs\ndemonstrates that large numbers of large-scale magnetic field reversals are not\nrequired to account for observations.\n",

It consists of a small-aperture, wide-field\nautomated telescope located at Winer Observatory near Sonoita, Arizona. The\ntelescope surveys a set of 26 x 26 degree fields, together covering about 25%\nof the Northern sky, targeting stars in the range of 8<V<10 mag, searching for\ntransits by close-in Jupiters. This paper describes the system hardware and\nsoftware and discusses the quality of the observations. We show that KELT is\nable to achieve the necessary photometric precision to detect planetary\ntransits around solar-type main sequence stars.\n",

One of\nthe two qubits interacts with a third qubit, a control, that is never entangled\nor correlated with either of the two entangled qubits and is never entangled,\nbut becomes correlated, with the system of those two qubits. The two entangled\nqubits do not interact, but their state can change from maximally entangled to\nseparable or from separable to maximally entangled. Similar changes for the two\nqubits are made with a swap operation between one of the qubits and a control;\nthen there are compensating changes of entanglement that involve the control.\nWhen the entanglement increases, the map that describes the change of the state\nof the two entangled qubits is not completely positive. Combination of two\nindependent interactions that individually give exponential decay of the\nentanglement can cause the entanglement to not decay exponentially but,\ninstead, go to zero at a finite time.\n",

The emission was predicted to contribute to the diffuse\nextragalactic background even at large angular distances from the Sun. While\nthis emission is expected to be readily detectable in future by GLAST, the\nsituation for available EGRET data is more challenging. We present a detailed\nstudy of the EGRET database, using a time dependent analysis, accounting for\nthe effect of the emission from 3C 279, the moon, and other sources, which\ninterfere with the solar signal. The technique has been tested on the moon\nsignal, with results consistent with previous work. We find clear evidence for\nemission from the Sun and its vicinity. The observations are compared with our\nmodel for the extended emission.\n",

These data confirm the presence of a cold dust disk\naround TWA 7, a member of the TW Hydrae Association. Based on the 850 micron\nflux, we estimate the mass of the disk to be 18 lunar masses (0.2 Earth masses)\nassuming a mass opacity of 1.7 cm^2/g with a temperature of 45 K. This makes\nthe TWA 7 disk (d=55 pc) an order of magnitude more massive than the disk\nreported around AU Microscopii (GL 803), the closest (9.9 pc) debris disk\ndetected around an M dwarf. This is consistent with TWA 7 being slightly\nyounger than AU Mic. We find that the mid-IR and submillimeter data require the\ndisk to be comprised of dust at a range of temperatures. A model in which the\ndust is at a single radius from the star, with a range of temperatures\naccording to grain size, is as effective at fitting the emission spectrum as a\nmodel in which the dust is of uniform size, but has a range of temperatures\naccording to distance. We discuss this disk in the context of known disks in\nthe TW Hydrae Association and around low-mass stars; a comparison of masses of\ndisks in the TWA reveals no trend in mass or evolutionary state (gas-rich vs.\ndebris) as a function of spectral type.\n",

        "abstract": "  A recently introduced nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation, derived directly from\na master equation, comes out as a very general tool to describe\nphenomenologically systems presenting complex behavior, like anomalous\ndiffusion, in the presence of external forces. Such an equation is\ncharacterized by a nonlinear diffusion term that may present, in general, two\ndistinct powers of the probability distribution. Herein, we calculate the\nstationary-state distributions of this equation in some special cases, and\nintroduce associated classes of generalized entropies in order to satisfy the\nH-theorem. Within this approach, the parameters associated with the transition\nrates of the original master-equation are related to such generalized\nentropies, and are shown to obey some restrictions. Some particular cases are\ndiscussed.\n",

        "abstract": "  We critically examine issues associated with determining the fundamental\nproperties of the black hole and the surrounding accretion disk in an X-ray\nbinary based on modeling the disk X-ray continuum of the source. We base our\nwork mainly on two XMM-Newton observations of GX 339-4, because they provided\nhigh-quality data at low energies (below 1 keV) which are critical for reliably\nmodeling the spectrum of the accretion disk. A key issue examined is the\ndetermination of the so-called \"color correction factor\", which is often\nempirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrum\nfrom a blackbody (due to electron scattering). This factor cannot be\npre-determined theoretically because it may vary with, e.g., mass accretion\nrate, among a number of important factors. We follow up on an earlier\nsuggestion to estimate the color correction observationally by modeling the\ndisk spectrum with saturated Compton scattering. We show that the spectra can\nbe fitted well and the approach yields reasonable values for the color\ncorrection factor. For comparison, we have also attempted to fit the spectra\nwith other models. We show that even the high-soft-state continuum (which is\ndominated by the disk emission) cannot be satisfactorily fitted by\nstate-of-the-art disk models. We discuss the implication of the results.\n",

We also construct systems in which different phases may nucleate\ncompetitively from a single initial phase. For such a system, we present a\ngeneral method to extract from numerical simulations the individual nucleation\nrates of the nucleating phases. The results show that the Ostwald rule, which\npredicts which phase will nucleate, must be modified probabilistically when the\nnew phases are almost equally stable. Finally, we show that the nucleation rate\nof a phase depends, among other things, on the number of other phases\naccessible from it.\n",

With this model we can construct, for example, a\nsystem which evolves through an arbitrarily long succession of metastable\nphases. We also construct systems in which different phases may nucleate\ncompetitively from a single initial phase. For such a system, we present a\ngeneral method to extract from numerical simulations the individual nucleation\nrates of the nucleating phases. The results show that the Ostwald rule, which\npredicts which phase will nucleate, must be modified probabilistically when the\nnew phases are almost equally stable. Finally, we show that the nucleation rate\nof a phase depends, among other things, on the number of other phases\naccessible from it.\n",

        "abstract": "  We present an analysis of new Suzaku data and archival data from XMM-Newton\nof the cluster of galaxies Sersic 159-03, which has a strong soft X-ray excess\nemission component. The Suzaku observation confirms the presence of the soft\nexcess emission, but it does not confirm the presence of redshifted OVII lines\nin the cluster. Radial profiles and 2D maps derived from XMM-Newton\nobservations show that the soft excess emission has a strong peak at the\nposition of the central cD galaxy and the maps do not show any significant\nazimuthal variations. Although the soft excess emission can be fitted equally\nwell with both thermal and non-thermal models, its spatial distribution is\nneither consistent with the models of intercluster warm-hot filaments, nor with\nmodels of clumpy warm intracluster gas associated with infalling groups. Using\nthe data obtained by the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometers we do not\nconfirm the presence of the warm gas in the cluster centre with the expected\nproperties assuming the soft excess is of thermal origin. The observed\nproperties of the soft excess emission are consistent with the non-thermal\ninterpretation. While the high density of relativistic electrons associated\nwith the peak of the soft emission in the cluster centre might have been\nprovided by an active galactic nucleus in the central cD galaxy, the underlying\npopulation might have been accelerated in diffuse shocks.\n",

We incorporate a new method for including the\nradiative cooling from metals into adaptive mesh-refinement hydrodynamic\nsimulations. Our results illustrate how metals, produced by the first stars,\nled to a transition from the high-mass star formation mode of Pop III stars, to\nthe low-mass mode that dominates today. We ran hydrodynamic simulations with\ncosmological initial conditions in the standard LambdaCDM model, with\nmetallicities, from zero to 10^-2 Zsolar, beginnning at redshift, z = 99. The\nsimulations were run until a dense core forms at the center of a 5 x 10^5\nMsolar dark matter halo, at z ~ 18. Analysis of the central 1 Msolar core\nreveals that the two simulations with the lowest metallicities, Z = 0 and 10^-4\nZsolar, contain one clump with 99% of the mass, while the two with\nmetallicities, Z = 10^-3 and 10^-2 Zsolar, each contain two clumps that share\nmost of the mass. The Z = 10^-3 Zsolar simulation also produced two low-mass\nproto-stellar objects with masses between 10^-2 and 10^-1 Msolar. Gas with Z >=\n10^-3 Zsolar is able to cool to the temperature of the CMB, which sets a lower\nlimit to the minimum fragmentation mass. This suggests that the second\ngeneration stars produced a spectrum of lower mass stars, but were still more\nmassive on average than stars formed in the local universe.\n",

The clusters have ages on the order of 10 Myr,\nwhich is many times longer than the crossing times implied by their velocity\ndispersions and radii. We therefore apply the Virial Theorem to derive the\nkinematic mass for 15 of the SSCs. The SSCs have masses of 2 x 10^5 to 4 x 10^6\nsolar masses, with a total population mass of 1.4 x 10^7 solar masses.\nComparison of the loci of the young M82 SSCs and old Milky Way globular\nclusters in a plot of radius versus velocity dispersion suggests that the SSCs\nare a population of potential globular clusters. We present the mass function\nfor the SSCs, and find a power law fit with an index of gamma = -1.91 +/- 0.06.\nThis result is nearly identical to the mass function of young SSCs in the\nAntennae galaxies.\n",

        "abstract": "  About 25% of the Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) exhibit unusually extended\ncolor distribution of stars in the horizontal-branch (HB) phase. This\nphenomenon is now best understood as due to the presence of helium enhanced\nsecond generation subpopulations, which has raised a possibility that these\npeculiar GCs might have a unique origin. Here we show that these GCs with\nextended HB are clearly distinct from other normal GCs in kinematics and mass.\nThe GCs with extended HB are more massive than normal GCs, and are dominated by\nrandom motion with no correlation between kinematics and metallicity.\nSurprisingly, however, when they are excluded, most normal GCs in the inner\nhalo show clear signs of dissipational collapse that apparently led to the\nformation of the disk. Normal GCs in the outer halo share their kinematic\nproperties with the extended HB GCs, which is consistent with the accretion\norigin. Our result further suggests heterogeneous origins of GCs, and we\nanticipate this to be a starting point for more detailed investigations of\nMilky Way formation, including early mergers, collapse, and later accretion.\n",

The vector related with spin has also\nbeen evaluated and the corresponding extra Hamiltonian is furnished. Further,\nwe use the teleparallel version of M$\\ddot{o}$ller prescription to find the\nenergy-momentum distribution of the solutions. It is interesting to note that\n(for $\\lambda=1$) energy and momentum densities in teleparallel theory are\nequal to the corresponding quantities in GR plus an additional quantity in\neach, which may become equal under certain conditions.

        "abstract": "  We find three distinct phases; a tubular phase, a planar phase, and the\nspherical phase, in a triangulated fluid surface model. It is also found that\nthese phases are separated by discontinuous transitions. The fluid surface\nmodel is investigated within the framework of the conventional curvature model\nby using the canonical Monte Carlo simulations with dynamical triangulations.\nThe mechanical strength of the surface is given only by skeletons, and no\ntwo-dimensional bending energy is assumed in the Hamiltonian. The skeletons are\ncomposed of elastic linear-chains and rigid junctions and form a\ncompartmentalized structure on the surface, and for this reason the vertices of\ntriangles can diffuse freely only inside the compartments. As a consequence, an\ninhomogeneous structure is introduced in the model; the surface strength inside\nthe compartments is different from the surface strength on the compartments.\nHowever, the rotational symmetry is not influenced by the elastic skeletons;\nthere is no specific direction on the surface. In addition to the three phases\nmentioned above, a collapsed phase is expected to exist in the low bending\nrigidity regime that was not studied here. The inhomogeneous structure and the\nfluidity of vertices are considered to be the origin of such variety of phases.\n",

The pre-equilibrium Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) is used\nto probe the fusion path. It is shown that such isovector collective state is\nexcited in N/Z asymmetric fusion and to a less extent in mass asymmetric\nsystems. The characteristics of this GDR are governed by the structure of the\nfused system in its preequilibrium phase, like its deformation, rotation and\nvibration. In particular, we show that a lowering of the pre-equilibrium GDR\nenergy is expected as compared to the statistical one. Revisiting experimental\ndata, we extract an evidence of this lowering for the first time. We also\nquantify the fusion-evaporation enhancement due to gamma-ray emission from the\npre-equilibrium GDR. This cooling mechanism along the fusion path may be\nsuitable to synthesize in the future super heavy elements using radioactive\nbeams with strong N/Z asymmetries in the entrance channel.\n",

        "abstract": "  Recent investigations have established an analogy between the entropy of\nfour-dimensional supersymmetric black holes in string theory and entanglement\nin quantum information theory. Examples include: (1) N=2 STU black holes and\nthe tripartite entanglement of three qubits (2-state systems), where the common\nsymmetry is [SL(2)]^3 and (2) N=8 black holes and the tripartite entanglement\nof seven qubits where the common symmetry is E_7 which contains [SL(2)]^7. Here\nwe present another example: N=8 black holes (or black strings) in five\ndimensions and the bipartite entanglement of three qutrits (3-state systems),\nwhere the common symmetry is E_6 which contains [SL(3)]^3. Both the black hole\n(or black string) entropy and the entanglement measure are provided by the\nCartan cubic E_6 invariant. Similar analogies exist for ``magic'' N=2\nsupergravity black holes in both four and five dimensions.\n",

The individuals of each species are\nlocalized over the sites of a lattice and the local stochastic updating rules\nare inspired on the processes of the Lotka-Volterra model. Two levels of\nmean-field approximations are set up. The simple approximation is equivalent to\nan extended patch model, a simple metapopulation model with patches colonized\nby prey, patches colonized by predators and empty patches. This approximation\nis capable of describing the limited available space for species occupancy. The\npair approximation is moreover able to describe two types of coexistence of\nprey and predators: one where population densities are constant in time and\nanother displaying self-sustained time-oscillations of the population\ndensities. The oscillations are associated with limit cycles and arise through\na Hopf bifurcation. They are stable against changes in the initial conditions\nand, in this sense, they differ from the Lotka-Volterra cycles which depend on\ninitial conditions. In this respect, the present model is biologically more\nrealistic than the Lotka-Volterra model.\n",

Whilst a relatively large number of long-period IPs are\nknown, very few of these have short orbital periods. We present phase-resolved\nspectroscopy and photometry of SDSS J233325.92+152222.1 and classify it as the\nIP with the shortest known orbital period (83.12 +/- 0.09 min), which contains\na white dwarf with a relatively long spin period (41.66 +/- 0.13 min). We\nestimate the white dwarf's magnetic moment to be mu(WD) \\approx 2 x 10^33 G\ncm^3, which is not only similar to three of the other four confirmed\nshort-period IPs but also to those of many of the long-period IPs. We suggest\nthat long-period IPs conserve their magnetic moment as they evolve towards\nshorter orbital periods. Therefore the dominant population of long-period IPs,\nwhich have white dwarf spin periods roughly ten times shorter than their\norbital periods, will likely end up as short-period IPs like SDSS J2333, with\nspin periods a large fraction of their orbital periods.\n",

The observations resolved the\nhot molecular core into six submm continuum sources with the finest spatial\nresolution of 0.36''x0.25'' (~1800AU) achieved so far. Four of them located\nwithin 7800(AU)^2 comprise a proto-Trapezium system with estimated protostellar\ndensities of 1.4x0^5 protostars/pc^3. The plethora of ~80 spectral lines allows\nus to study the molecular outflow(s), the core kinematics, the temperature\nstructure of the region as well as chemical effects. The derived hot core\ntemperatures are of the order 300K. We find interesting chemical spatial\ndifferentiations, e.g., C34S is deficient toward the hot core and is enhanced\nat the UCHII/hot core interface, which may be explained by temperature\nsensitive desorption from grains and following gas phase chemistry. The\nSiO(8-7) emission outlines likely two molecular outflows emanating from this\nhot core region. Emission from most other molecules peaks centrally on the hot\ncore and is not dominated by any individual submm peak. Potential reasons for\nthat are discussed. A few spectral lines that are associated with the main\nsubmm continuum source, show a velocity gradient perpendicular to the\nlarge-scale outflow. Since this velocity structure comprises three of the\ncentral protostellar sources, this is not a Keplerian disk. While the data are\nconsistent with a gas core that may rotate and/or collapse, we cannot exclude\nthe outflow(s) and/or nearby expanding UCHII region as possible alternative\ncauses of this velocity pattern.\n",

        "abstract": "  In this paper we investigate some entanglement properties for the Hydrogen\nmolecule considered as a two interacting spin 1/2 (qubit) model. The\nentanglement related to the $H_{2}$ molecule is evaluated both using the von\nNeumann entropy and the Concurrence and it is compared with the corresponding\nquantities for the two interacting spin system. Many aspects of these functions\nare examinated employing in part analytical and, essentially, numerical\ntechniques. We have compared analogous results obtained by Huang and Kais a few\nyears ago. In this respect, some possible controversial situations are\npresented and discussed.\n",

We calculate quantum mechanical ground states, low--lying\nexcitations and spectral functions of finite lattices by means of numerical\ndiagonalization. The ground state of the most thoroughfully studied case, the\ncriss-crossed checkerboard lattice, is degenerate and shows long--range order.\nStatic fractional charges are confined by a weak linear force, most probably\nleading to bound states of large spatial extent. Consequently, the\nquasi-particle weight is reduced, which reflects the internal dynamics of the\nfractionally charged excitations. By using an additional parameter, we\nfine--tune the system to a special point at which fractional charges are\nmanifestly deconfined--the so--called Rokhsar--Kivelson point. For a deeper\nunderstanding of the low--energy physics of these models and for numerical\nadvantages, several conserved quantum numbers are identified.\n",

This material presents\natomically flat surfaces, yielding spatially homogeneous spectra which reveal\nfully-gapped superconductivity with a gap anisotropy of 30%. Measurements\nperformed at fields of 2 and 6 T display a hexagonal Abrikosov flux line\nlattice. From the shape of the vortex cores, we extract a coherence length of\n31-40 {\\AA}, in agreement with the value derived from the upper critical field\nHc2. We observe a reduction in size of the vortex cores (and hence the\ncoherence length) with increasing field which is consistent with the\nunexpectedly high and unsaturated upper critical field reported.\n",

X-ray\nintensities were observed at a forbidden Bragg position in the ferroelectric\nphases, in addition to the lattice and the magnetic modulation peaks.\nTemperature dependences of their intensities and the relation between the\nmodulation wave vectors provide direct evidences of exchange striction induced\nferroelectricity. Resonant x-ray scattering results demonstrate the presence of\nmultiple magnetic orders by exhibiting their different temperature dependences.\nThe commensurate-to-incommensurate phase transition around 24 K is attributed\nto discommensuration through phase slipping of the magnetic orders in spin\nfrustrated geometries. We proposed that the low temperature incommensurate\nphase consists of the commensurate magnetic domains separated by anti-phase\ndomain walls which reduce spontaneous polarizations abruptly at the transition.\n",

        "abstract": "  A combination of experimental techniques and molecular dynamics (MD) computer\nsimulation is used to investigate the diffusion dynamics in Al80Ni20 melts.\nExperimentally, the self-diffusion coefficient of Ni is measured by the\nlong-capillary (LC) method and by quasielastic neutron scattering. The LC\nmethod yields also the interdiffusion coefficient. Whereas the experiments were\ndone in the normal liquid state, the simulations provided the determination of\nboth self-diffusion and interdiffusion constants in the undercooled regime as\nwell. The simulation results show good agreement with the experimental data. In\nthe temperature range 3000 K >= T >= 715 K, the interdiffusion coefficient is\nlarger than the self-diffusion constants. Furthermore the simulation shows that\nthis difference becomes larger in the undercooled regime. This result can be\nrefered to a relatively strong temperature dependence of the thermodynamic\nfactor \\Phi, which describes the thermodynamic driving force for\ninterdiffusion. The simulations also indicate that the Darken equation is a\ngood approximation, even in the undercooled regime. This implies that dynamic\ncross correlations play a minor role for the temperature range under\nconsideration.\n",

Understanding the mechanisms which\nlead to multiple globular cluster sub-populations is essential for a complete\npicture of massive galaxy formation. By assuming that globular cluster\nformation traces the total star formation and taking into account the radial\nvariations in the composite stellar populations predicted by the Pipino &\nMatteucci (2004) multi-zone photo-chemical evolution code, we compute the\ndistribution of globular cluster properties as a function of galactocentric\nradius. We compare our results to the spectroscopic measurements of globular\nclusters in nearby early-type galaxies by Puzia et al. (2006) and show that the\nobserved multi-modality in globular cluster systems of massive ellipticals can\nbe, at least partly, ascribed to the radial variation in the mix of stellar\npopulations. Our model predicts the presence of a super-metal-rich population\nof globular clusters in the most massive elliptical galaxies, which is in very\ngood agreement with the spectroscopic observations. Furthermore, we investigate\nthe impact of other non-linear mechanisms that shape the metallicity\ndistribution of globular cluster systems, in particular the role of\nmerger-induced globular cluster formation and a non-linear color-metallicity\ntransformation, and discuss their influence in the context of our model\n(abridged)\n",

        "abstract": "  The effect of possible in-medium modifications of nucleon-nucleon ($NN$)\ncross sections on particle production is investigated in heavy ion collisions\n($HIC$) at intermediate energies. In particular, using a fully covariant\nrelativistic transport approach, we see that the density dependence of the {\\it\ninelastic} cross sections appreciably affects the pion and kaon yields and\ntheir rapidity distributions. However, the $(\\pi^{-}/\\pi^{+})$- and\n$(K^{0}/K^{+})$-ratios depend only moderately on the in-medium behavior of the\ninelastic cross sections. This is particularly true for kaon yield ratios,\nsince kaons are more uniformly produced in high density regions. Kaon\npotentials are also suitably evaluated in two schemes, a chiral perturbative\napproach and an effective meson-quark coupling method, with consistent results\nshowing a similar repulsive contribution for $K^{+}$ and $K^{0}$. As a\nconsequence we expect rather reduced effects on the yield ratios. We conclude\nthat particle ratios appear to be robust observables for probing the nuclear\nequation of state ($EoS$) at high baryon density and, particularly, its\nisovector sector.\n",

We further show how to exactly\nrepresent the CF wavefunctions in the Jain series $\\nu = s/(2sp+1)$ as the CFT\ncorrelators of a new type of fermionic vertex operators, $V_{p,n}(z)$,\nconstructed from $n$ free compactified bosons; these operators provide the CFT\nrepresentation of composite fermions carrying $2p$ flux quanta in the $n^{\\rm\nth}$ CF Landau level. We also construct the corresponding quasiparticle- and\nquasihole operators and argue that they have the expected fractional charge and\nstatistics. For filling fractions 2/5 and 3/7 we show that the chiral CFTs that\ndescribe the bulk wave functions are identical to those given by Wen's general\nclassification of quantum Hall states in terms of $K$-matrices and $l$- and\n$t$-vectors, and we propose that to be generally true. Our results suggest a\ngeneral procedure for constructing quasiparticle wave functions for other\nfractional Hall states, as well as for constructing ground states at filling\nfractions not contained in the principal Jain series.\n",

Since the dipolar\ninteraction favorizes the formation of antiparallel chain-like structures,\nantiparallel chain-like patterns are frozen in at low temperatures, leading to\naging phenomena characteristic for spin-glasses.

These analyses confirm the existence\nof a real-estate bubble, defined as a price acceleration faster than\nexponential, which is found however to be confined to a rather limited time\ninterval in the recent past from approximately 2003 to mid-2004 and has\nprogressively transformed into a more normal growth rate comparable to\npre-bubble levels in 2005. There has been no bubble till 2002 except for a\nmedium-sized surge in 1990. In addition, we have identified a strong yearly\nperiodicity which provides a good potential for fine-tuned prediction from\nmonth to month. A monthly monitoring using a model that we have developed could\nconfirm, by testing the intra-year structure, if indeed the market has returned\nto ``normal'' or if more turbulence is expected ahead. We predict the evolution\nof the indexes one year ahead, which is validated with new data up to Sep.\n2006. The present analysis demonstrates the existence of very significant\nvariations at the local scale, in the sense that the bubble in Las Vegas seems\nto have preceded the more global USA bubble and has ended approximately two\nyears earlier (mid 2004 for Las Vegas compared with mid-2006 for the whole of\nthe USA).\n",

We found that the critical behavior of the resistivity,\nrho, in this clean system contrasts sharply with those observed in its\ndisordered analogue, NiS_{2-x}Se_{x} solid-solution, demonstrating the\nunexpectedly drastic effect of disorder on the quantum criticality. Over a\nwhole paramagnetic region investigated up to P = 9 GPa, a crossover\ntemperature, defined as the onset of T^{2} dependence of rho, an indication of\nFermi liquid, was suppressed to a substantially low temperature T sim 2 K and,\ninstead, a non Fermi liquid behavior of rho, T^{3/2}-dependence, robustly\nshowed up.\n",

Furthermore their evolution is\nconditioned by deterministic laws which often are not correlated with the\nstructural parameters and the global status of the network, as it should happen\nin a real biological system. In nature the environmental inputs are noise\naffected and fuzzy. Which thing sets the problem to investigate the possibility\nof emergent behaviour in a not strictly constrained net and subjected to\ndifferent inputs. It is here presented a new model of Evolutionary Neural Gas\n(ENG) with any topological constraints, trained by probabilistic laws depending\non the local distortion errors and the network dimension. The network is\nconsidered as a population of nodes that coexist in an ecosystem sharing local\nand global resources. Those particular features allow the network to quickly\nadapt to the environment, according to its dimensions. The ENG model analysis\nshows that the net evolves as a scale-free graph, and justifies in a deeply\nphysical sense- the term gas here used.\n",

The ratio of inter- to\nintraplane coupling is estimated to be |J'/J|=1.9 x 10^-2, while fits of the\ntemperature dependence of the order parameter reveal a critical exponent\nbeta=0.292(3), implying an intermediate character between pure two- and three-\ndimensional magnetism in the critical regime.

Performing a numerical solution we confirm the earlier result\nof [hep-ph/0408216] that the high energy evolution with the running coupling\nleads to a universal scaling behavior for the dipole scattering amplitude. The\nrunning coupling corrections calculated recently significantly change the shape\nof the scaling function as compared to the fixed coupling case leading to a\nconsiderable increase in the anomalous dimension and to a slow-down of the\nevolution with rapidity. The difference between the two recent calculations is\ndue to an extra contribution to the evolution kernel, referred to as the\nsubtraction term, which arises when running coupling corrections are included.\nThese subtraction terms were neglected in both recent calculations. We evaluate\nnumerically the subtraction terms for both calculations, and demonstrate that\nwhen the subtraction terms are added back to the evolution kernels obtained in\nthe two works the resulting dipole amplitudes agree with each other! We then\nuse the complete running coupling kernel including the subtraction term to find\nthe numerical solution of the resulting full non-linear evolution equation with\nthe running coupling corrections. Again the scaling regime is recovered at very\nlarge rapidity.\n",

If the\nelectromigration driving force acts in the step up/down direction, and\nstep-edge diffusion is the dominant mass-transport mechanism, we find that\nsignificant deviations from the usual $t^{1/4}$ scaling of the terrace-width\ncorrelation function occurs for a critical time $\\tau$ which is dependent upon\nthe three energy scales in the problem: $k_{B}T$, the step stiffness, $\\gamma$,\nand the bias associated with adatom hopping under the influence of an\nelectromigration force, $\\pm \\Delta U$. For ($t < \\tau$), the correlation\nfunction evolves as a superposition of $t^{1/4}$ and $t^{3/4}$ power laws. For\n$t \\ge \\tau$ a closed form expression can be derived. This behavior is\nconfirmed by a Monte-Carlo simulation using a discrete model of the step\ndynamics. It is proposed that the magnitude of the electromigration force\nacting upon an atom at a step-edge can by estimated by a careful analysis of\nthe statistical properties of step-edge fluctuations on the appropriate\ntime-scale.\n",

The evolution of non-Gaussianity is also analyzed\nfor quantum states undergoing the processes of Gaussification by loss and\nde-Gaussification by photon-subtraction. The suggested measure is easily\ncomputable for any state of a bosonic system and allows to define a\ncorresponding measure for the non-Gaussian character of a quantum operation.\n",

I discuss various implications of the ERH and\nMUH, ranging from standard physics topics like symmetries, irreducible\nrepresentations, units, free parameters, randomness and initial conditions to\nbroader issues like consciousness, parallel universes and Godel incompleteness.\nI hypothesize that only computable and decidable (in Godel's sense) structures\nexist, which alleviates the cosmological measure problem and help explain why\nour physical laws appear so simple. I also comment on the intimate relation\nbetween mathematical structures, computations, simulations and physical\nsystems.\n",

        "abstract": "  Future detection/non-detection of tensor modes from inflation in CMB\nobservations presents a unique way to test certain features of string theory.\nCurrent limit on the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations, r=T/S, is r <\n0.3, future detection may take place for r > 10^{-2}-10^{-3}. At present all\nknown string theory inflation models predict tensor modes well below the level\nof detection. Therefore a possible experimental discovery of tensor modes may\npresent a challenge to string cosmology.\n  The strongest bound on r in string inflation follows from the observation\nthat in most of the models based on the KKLT construction, the value of the\nHubble constant H during inflation must be smaller than the gravitino mass. For\nthe gravitino mass in the usual range, m_{3/2} < O(1) TeV, this leads to an\nextremely strong bound r < 10^{-24}. A discovery of tensor perturbations with r\n> 10^{-3} would imply that the gravitinos in this class of models are\nsuperheavy, m_{3/2} > 10^{13} GeV. This would have important implications for\nparticle phenomenology based on string theory.\n",

        "abstract": "  When the DNA double helix is subjected to external forces it can stretch\nelastically to elongations reaching 100% of its natural length. These\ndistortions, imposed at the mesoscopic or macroscopic scales, have a dramatic\neffect on electronic properties at the atomic scale and on electrical transport\nalong DNA. Accordingly, a multiscale approach is necessary to capture the\nelectronic behavior of the stretched DNA helix. To construct such a model, we\nbegin with accurate density-functional-theory calculations for electronic\nstates in DNA bases and base pairs in various relative configurations\nencountered in the equilibrium and stretched forms. These results are\ncomplemented by semi-empirical quantum mechanical calculations for the states\nof a small size [18 base pair poly(CG)-poly(CG)] dry, neutral DNA sequence,\nusing previously published models for stretched DNA. The calculated electronic\nstates are then used to parametrize an effective tight-binding model that can\ndescribe electron hopping in the presence of environmental effects, such as the\npresence of stray water molecules on the backbone or structural features of the\nsubstrate. These effects introduce disorder in the model hamiltonian which\nleads to electron localization. The localization length is smaller by several\norders of magnitude in stretched DNA relative to that in the unstretched\nstructure.\n",

        "abstract": "  When the DNA double helix is subjected to external forces it can stretch\nelastically to elongations reaching 100% of its natural length. These\ndistortions, imposed at the mesoscopic or macroscopic scales, have a dramatic\neffect on electronic properties at the atomic scale and on electrical transport\nalong DNA. Accordingly, a multiscale approach is necessary to capture the\nelectronic behavior of the stretched DNA helix. To construct such a model, we\nbegin with accurate density-functional-theory calculations for electronic\nstates in DNA bases and base pairs in various relative configurations\nencountered in the equilibrium and stretched forms. These results are\ncomplemented by semi-empirical quantum mechanical calculations for the states\nof a small size [18 base pair poly(CG)-poly(CG)] dry, neutral DNA sequence,\nusing previously published models for stretched DNA. The calculated electronic\nstates are then used to parametrize an effective tight-binding model that can\ndescribe electron hopping in the presence of environmental effects, such as the\npresence of stray water molecules on the backbone or structural features of the\nsubstrate. These effects introduce disorder in the model hamiltonian which\nleads to electron localization. The localization length is smaller by several\norders of magnitude in stretched DNA relative to that in the unstretched\nstructure.\n",

Effects of optical loss, group-velocity dispersion, and\nKerr nonlinearity on the position and momentum of an optical pulse are studied\nvia Heisenberg equations of motion. Using the developed formalism, the impact\nof decoherence by optical loss on the use of adiabatic soliton control for\nbeating the timing standard quantum limit [Tsang, Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 023902\n(2006)] is analyzed theoretically and numerically. The analysis shows that an\nappreciable enhancement can be achieved using current technology, despite an\nincrease in timing jitter mainly due to the Gordon-Haus effect. The decoherence\neffect of optical loss on the transmission of quantum-enhanced timing\ninformation is also studied, in order to identify situations in which the\nenhancement is able to survive.\n",

Unlike most forms of\nstochastic resonance, the output response to suprathreshold random input\nsignals of arbitrary magnitude is improved by the presence of even small\namounts of noise. In this paper the information transmission performance of SSR\nin the limit of a large array size is considered. Using a relationship between\nShannon's mutual information and Fisher information, a sufficient condition for\noptimality, i.e. channel capacity, is derived. It is shown that capacity is\nachieved when the signal distribution is Jeffrey's prior, as formed from the\nnoise distribution, or when the noise distribution depends on the signal\ndistribution via a cosine relationship. These results provide theoretical\nverification and justification for previous work in both computational\nneuroscience and electronics.\n",

For the basic\nprocedure, sources of number states leak onto a beam splitter, and the output\nports are monitored by photodetectors. We find that detecting a fixed fraction\nof the input at one output port suffices to direct the remainder to the same\nport with high probability, however large the initial state. When instead\nphotons are detected at both ports, Schr\\\"{o}dinger cat states are produced. We\ndescribe a circuit for making the components of such a state orthogonal, and\nanother for subsequent conversion to a N00N state. Our approach scales\nexponentially better than existing proposals.

        "abstract": "  To explain the cosmic speed up, brought to light by the recent SNIa and CMB\nobservations, we propose the following: a) In a spacetime endowed with a FRW\nmetric, we choose an empirical scale factor that best explains the\nobservations. b) We assume a modified gravity, generated by an unspecified\nfield lagrangian, $f(R)$. c) We use the adopted empirical scale factor to work\nback retroactively to obtain $f(R)$, hence the term `Inverse $f(R)$'. d) Next\nwe consider the classic GR and a conventional FRW universe that, in addition to\nits known baryonic content, possesses a hypothetical `Dark Energy' component.\nWe compare the two scenarios, and find the density, the pressure, and the\nequation of the state of the Dark Energy required to make up for the\ndifferences between the conventional and the modified GR models.\n",

This unexpected phenomenon is explained by\nthe analysis of the spin-wave spectrum. We demonstrate that the square of the\nspin-wave gap becomes negative under magnetic field applied along $<111>$ and\n$<110>$ but not along the $<100>$ direction. It is a result of competition\nbetween the spin-wave interaction and cubic anisotropy. This negative sign\nmeans an instability of the spin wave spectrum for the helix and leads to a\ndestruction of the helical order, giving rise to the partially disordered state\nbelow the first order ferromagnetic transition.\n",

We examined the\ndifferent definitions and identified the similarities and differences between\nthem. In order to elucidate the significance of different definitions of the\nweighted clustering coefficient, we studied their dependence on the weights of\nthe connections. For this purpose, we introduce the relative perturbation norm\nof the weights as an index to assess the weight distribution.

We prove\nthat the asymptotic shape of this model is a Euclidean ball, in a sense which\nis stronger than our earlier work. For the shape consisting of $n=\\omega_d r^d$\nsites, where $\\omega_d$ is the volume of the unit ball in $\\R^d$, we show that\nthe inradius of the set of occupied sites is at least $r-O(\\log r)$, while the\noutradius is at most $r+O(r^\\alpha)$ for any $\\alpha > 1-1/d$. For a related\nmodel, the divisible sandpile, we show that the domain of occupied sites is a\nEuclidean ball with error in the radius a constant independent of the total\nmass. For the classical abelian sandpile model in two dimensions, with $n=\\pi\nr^2$ particles, we show that the inradius is at least $r/\\sqrt{3}$, and the\noutradius is at most $(r+o(r))/\\sqrt{2}$. This improves on bounds of Le Borgne\nand Rossin. Similar bounds apply in higher dimensions.\n",

The\nuse of these properties allows rigorous derivation and simplification of the\nexpressions of the frequency matrix (FM) and of the generalized mean field\napproximation (GMFA) Green functions (GFs) of the model.\n  For the normal singlet hopping and anomalous exchange pairing correlation\nfunctions which enter the FM and GMFA-GFs, an approximation procedure based on\nthe identification and elimination of exponentially small quantities is\ndescribed.

        "abstract": "  The Green function (GF) equation of motion technique for solving the\neffective two-band Hubbard model of high-T_c superconductivity in cuprates\n[N.M. Plakida et al., Phys. Rev. B, v. 51, 16599 (1995); JETP, v. 97, 331\n(2003)] rests on the Hubbard operator (HO) algebra. We show that, if we take\ninto account the invariance to translations and spin reversal, the HO algebra\nresults in invariance properties of several specific correlation functions. The\nuse of these properties allows rigorous derivation and simplification of the\nexpressions of the frequency matrix (FM) and of the generalized mean field\napproximation (GMFA) Green functions (GFs) of the model.\n  For the normal singlet hopping and anomalous exchange pairing correlation\nfunctions which enter the FM and GMFA-GFs, an approximation procedure based on\nthe identification and elimination of exponentially small quantities is\ndescribed. It secures the reduction of the correlation order to GMFA-GF\nexpressions.\n",

A biradical mechanism has been envisaged for each\ncycloalkane, and the main routes for the decomposition of the biradicals formed\nhave been investigated at the CBS-QB3 level of theory. Thermochemical data\n(\\delta H^0_f, S^0, C^0_p) for all the involved species have been obtained by\nmeans of isodesmic reactions. The contribution of hindered rotors has also been\nincluded. Activation barriers of each reaction have been analyzed to assess the\n1 energetically most favorable pathways for the decomposition of biradicals.\nRate constants have been derived for all elementary reactions using transition\nstate theory at 1 atm and temperatures ranging from 600 to 2000 K. Global rate\nconstant for the decomposition of the cyclic alkanes in molecular products have\nbeen calculated. Comparison between calculated and experimental results allowed\nto validate the theoretical approach. An important result is that the\nrotational barriers between the conformers, which are usually neglected, are of\nimportance in decomposition rate of the largest biradicals. Ring strain\nenergies (RSE) in transition states for ring opening have been estimated and\nshow that the main part of RSE contained in the cyclic reactants is removed\nupon the activation process.\n",

After a presentation of some general properties of\nYb-doped materials, we address the issue of evaluating the temperature map in\nYb-doped laser crystals, both theoretically and experimentally. This is the\nfirst step before studying the complex problem of thermal lensing (part III).\nWe will focus on some newly discussed aspects, like the definition of the\nthermo-optic coefficient: we will highlight some misleading interpretations of\nthermal lensing experiments due to the use of the dn/dT parameter in a context\nwhere it is not relevant. Part IV will be devoted to a state-of-the-art of\nexperimental techniques used to measure thermal lensing. Eventually, in part V,\nwe will give some concrete examples in Yb-doped materials, where their\npeculiarities will be pointed out.\n",

        "abstract": "  We present a numerical study and analytical model of the optical near-field\ndiffracted in the vicinity of subwavelength grooves milled in silver surfaces.\nThe Green's tensor approach permits computation of the phase and amplitude\ndependence of the diffracted wave as a function of the groove geometry. It is\nshown that the field diffracted along the interface by the groove is equivalent\nto replacing the groove by an oscillating dipolar line source. An analytic\nexpression is derived from the Green's function formalism, that reproduces well\nthe asymptotic surface plasmon polariton (SPP) wave as well as the transient\nsurface wave in the near-zone close to the groove. The agreement between this\nmodel and the full simulation is very good, showing that the transient\n\"near-zone\" regime does not depend on the precise shape of the groove. Finally,\nit is shown that a composite diffractive evanescent wave model that includes\nthe asymptotic SPP can describe the wavelength evolution in this transient\nnear-zone. Such a semi-analytical model may be useful for the design and\noptimization of more elaborate photonic circuits whose behavior in large part\nwill be controlled by surface waves.\n",

Glauber calculations, for example,\ntypically adopt the first-order eikonal approximation. We present an extension\nof the relativistic eikonal approach to $A(e,e'p)$ which accounts for\nsecond-order eikonal corrections. The numerical calculations are performed\nwithin the relativistic optical model eikonal approximation. The nuclear\ntransparency results indicate that the effect of the second-order eikonal\ncorrections is rather modest, even at $Q^{2} \\approx 0.2$ (GeV/c)$^2$. The same\napplies to polarization observables, left-right asymmetries, and differential\ncross sections at low missing momenta. At high missing momenta, however, the\nsecond-order eikonal corrections are significant and bring the calculations in\ncloser agreement with the data and/or the exact results from models adopting\npartial-wave expansions.\n",

        "abstract": "  We study gravitational waves from a particle moving around a system of a\npoint mass with a disk in Newtonian gravitational theory. A particle motion in\nthis system can be chaotic when the gravitational contribution from a surface\ndensity of a disk is comparable with that from a point mass. In such an orbit,\nwe sometimes find that there appears a phase of the orbit in which particle\nmotion becomes to be nearly regular (the so-called ``stagnant motion'') for a\nfinite time interval between more strongly chaotic phases. To study how these\ndifferent chaotic behaviours affect on observation of gravitational waves, we\ninvestigate a correlation of the particle motion and the waves. We find that\nsuch a difference in chaotic motions reflects on the wave forms and energy\nspectra. The character of the waves in the stagnant motion is quite different\nfrom that either in a regular motion or in a more strongly chaotic motion. This\nsuggests that we may make a distinction between different chaotic behaviours of\nthe orbit via the gravitational waves.\n",

The propagators and the\nFaddeev-Popov operator behave as expected from the Gribov-Zwanziger scenario.\nIn addition, finite volume effects affecting these Green's functions are\ninvestigated systematically.

For this purpose\nlattices of volume up to (42.7 fm)^2 have been used.\n",

As an\napplication, we study the heat dissipation in current carrying atomic junctions\nwithin the self-consistent Born approximation, which guarantees energy current\nconservation.

Recently it has been reasoned that this rotation applies also to the\ntransmitted image (Padgett et al. 2006). We examine these two phenomena by\nextending an analysis of Player (1976) to general electromagnetic fields. We\nfind that in this more general case the wave equation inside the rotating\nmedium has to be amended by a term which is connected to the orbital angular\nmomentum of the light. We show that optical spin and orbital angular momentum\naccount respectively for the rotation of the polarisation and the rotation of\nthe transmitted image.\n",

        "abstract": "  We perform a systematic study of the impact of the J^2 tensor term in the\nSkyrme energy functional on properties of spherical nuclei. In the Skyrme\nenergy functional, the tensor terms originate both from zero-range central and\ntensor forces. We build a set of 36 parameterizations, which covers a wide\nrange of the parameter space of the isoscalar and isovector tensor term\ncoupling constants, with a fit protocol very similar to that of the successful\nSLy parameterizations. We analyze the impact of the tensor terms on a large\nvariety of observables in spherical mean-field calculations, such as the\nspin-orbit splittings and single-particle spectra of doubly-magic nuclei, the\nevolution of spin-orbit splittings along chains of semi-magic nuclei, mass\nresiduals of spherical nuclei, and known anomalies of charge radii. Our main\nconclusion is that the currently used central and spin-orbit parts of the\nSkyrme energy density functional are not flexible enough to allow for the\npresence of large tensor terms.\n",

The variation of $\\Delta\\sigma_\\mathrm{ee}(L_T)$ as a\nfunction of the thermal length $L_T$ is found very similar to the variation of\nthe weak localization $\\Delta\\sigma_\\mathrm{WL}(L_\\phi)$ as a function of the\nphase coherence length. Our result for $\\Delta\\sigma_\\mathrm{ee}$ interpolates\nbetween the known 1d and 2d results, but the interaction parameter entering the\nexpression of $\\Delta\\sigma_\\mathrm{ee}$ keeps a 1d behaviour.

        "abstract": "  The rich set of interactions between individuals in the society results in\ncomplex community structure, capturing highly connected circles of friends,\nfamilies, or professional cliques in a social network. Thanks to frequent\nchanges in the activity and communication patterns of individuals, the\nassociated social and communication network is subject to constant evolution.\nOur knowledge of the mechanisms governing the underlying community dynamics is\nlimited, but is essential for a deeper understanding of the development and\nself-optimisation of the society as a whole. We have developed a new algorithm\nbased on clique percolation, that allows, for the first time, to investigate\nthe time dependence of overlapping communities on a large scale and as such, to\nuncover basic relationships characterising community evolution. Our focus is on\nnetworks capturing the collaboration between scientists and the calls between\nmobile phone users. We find that large groups persist longer if they are\ncapable of dynamically altering their membership, suggesting that an ability to\nchange the composition results in better adaptability. The behaviour of small\ngroups displays the opposite tendency, the condition for stability being that\ntheir composition remains unchanged. We also show that the knowledge of the\ntime commitment of the members to a given community can be used for estimating\nthe community's lifetime. These findings offer a new view on the fundamental\ndifferences between the dynamics of small groups and large institutions.\n",

        "abstract": "  A quantum system composed of two or more subsystems can be in an entangled\nstate, i.e. a state in which the properties of the global system are well\ndefined but the properties of each subsystem are not. Entanglement is at the\nheart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for\napplications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably,\nentanglement can be \"swapped\": if one prepares two independent entangled pairs\nA1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a \"Bell-State\nMeasurement\", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled\nstate, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common\npast[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric\ndown-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6],\nbut here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources,\nas originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp\nsynchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the\ncoherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased,\nexceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be\nreplaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing\nfor the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experiment\nexploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in the\nefficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinear\ncrystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters. This approach is\nindependent of the form of entanglement; we employed time-bin entangled\nphotons[9] at telecom wavelengths. Our setup is robust against thermal or\nmechanical fluctuations in optical fibres thanks to cm-long coherence lengths.\n",

We predict that in general the\ntunneling process becomes quasiperiodic. In a certain regime of parameters a\ncollapse and revival of the tunneling occurs. Accessing the internal degrees of\nfreedom of the atom with a laser allows to coherently manipulate the atom\nposition, and in particular to prepare the atom in one of the two wells.

After reviewing various meanings of the term\n``nonlocal'', we show that by using appropriately retarded wavefunctions (i.e.,\nthe locality loophole) this local model can violate Bell's inequality, without\nmaking any appeal to detector inefficiencies.\n  We analyze a possible experimental configuration appropriate to massive\ntwo-particle singlet wavefunctions and find that as long as the particles are\nnot ultra-relativistic, a locality loophole exists and Dirac wave(s) can\npropagate from Alice or Bob's changing magnetic field, through space, to the\nother detector, arriving before the particle and thereby allowing a local\ninterpretation to the 2-particle de Broglie-Bohm trajectories.\n  We also propose a physical effect due to changing magnetic fields in a\nStern-Gerlach EPR setup that will throw away events and create a detector\nloophole in otherwise perfectly efficient detectors, an effect that is only\nsignificant for near-luminal particles that might otherwise close the locality\nloophole.\n",

We find that this emerging\nmarket exhibits strong correlations in the movement of stock prices compared to\ndeveloped markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). This is shown to\nbe due to the dominant influence of a common market mode on the stock prices.\nBy comparison, interactions between related stocks, e.g., those belonging to\nthe same business sector, are much weaker. This lack of distinct sector\nidentity in emerging markets is explicitly shown by reconstructing the network\nof mutually interacting stocks. Spectral analysis of C for NSE reveals that,\nthe few largest eigenvalues deviate from the bulk of the spectrum predicted by\nrandom matrix theory, but they are far fewer in number compared to, e.g., NYSE.\nWe show this to be due to the relative weakness of intra-sector interactions\nbetween stocks, compared to the market mode, by modeling stock price dynamics\nwith a two-factor model. Our results suggest that the emergence of an internal\nstructure comprising multiple groups of strongly coupled components is a\nsignature of market development.\n",

Numerical solutions computed using\ndifferent boundary treatments are compared to a `reference' numerical solution\nobtained by placing the outer boundary at a very large radius. For each\nboundary treatment, the full solutions including constraint violations and\nextracted gravitational waves are compared to those of the reference solution,\nthereby assessing the reflections caused by the artificial boundary. These\ntests use a first-order generalized harmonic formulation of the Einstein\nequations. Constraint-preserving boundary conditions for this system are\nreviewed, and an improved boundary condition on the gauge degrees of freedom is\npresented. Alternate boundary conditions evaluated here include freezing the\nincoming characteristic fields, Sommerfeld boundary conditions, and the\nconstraint-preserving boundary conditions of Kreiss and Winicour. Rather\ndifferent approaches to boundary treatments, such as sponge layers and spatial\ncompactification, are also tested. Overall the best treatment found here\ncombines boundary conditions that preserve the constraints, freeze the\nNewman-Penrose scalar Psi_0, and control gauge reflections.\n",

        "abstract": "  Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) films have been shown to demonstrate various\ntribological behaviors: in ultra-high vacuum (UHV), with either friction\ncoefficients as low as 0.01 or less and very mild wear, or very high friction\ncoefficients (>0.4) and drastic wear. These behaviors depend notably on gaseous\nenvironment, hydrogen content of the film [1], and on its viscoplastic\nproperties [2,3]. A relation between superlow friction in UHV and\nviscoplasticity has indeed been established for a-C:H films and confirmed for a\nfluorinated sample (a-C:F:H). In this study, nanoindentation and nanoscratch\ntests were conducted in ambient air, using a nanoindentation apparatus, in\norder to evaluate tribological behaviors, as well as mechanical and\nviscoplastic properties of different amorphous carbon films.\n",

We take the light meson in the final state to be a pseudoscalar\ncorresponding to the exact chiral symmetry of staggered quarks. The treatment\nassumes the validity of the standard prescription for representing the\nstaggered ``fourth root trick'' within \\schpt by insertions of factors of 1/4\nfor each sea quark loop. Our calculation is based on an existing partially\nquenched continuum chiral perturbation theory calculation with degenerate sea\nquarks by Becirevic, Prelovsek and Zupan, which we generalize to the staggered\n(and non-degenerate) case. As a by-product, we obtain the continuum partially\nquenched results with non-degenerate sea quarks. We analyze the effects of\nnon-leading chiral terms, and find a relation among the coefficients governing\nthe analytic valence mass dependence at this order. Our results are useful in\nanalyzing lattice computations of form factors $B\\to\\pi$ and $D\\to K$ when the\nlight quarks are simulated with the staggered action.\n",

        "abstract": "  The nonlinear saturation of the r-mode instability and its effects on the\nspin evolution of Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) are modeled using the triplet\nof modes at the lowest parametric instability threshold. We solve numerically\nthe coupled equations for the three mode amplitudes in conjunction with the\nspin and temperature evolution equations. We observe that very quickly the mode\namplitudes settle into quasi-stationary states. Once these states are reached,\nthe mode amplitudes can be found algebraically and the system of equations is\nreduced from eight to two equations: spin and temperature evolution.\nEventually, the system may reach thermal equilibrium and either (1) undergo a\ncyclic evolution with a frequency change of at most 10%, (2) evolve toward a\nfull equilibrium state in which the accretion torque balances the gravitational\nradiation emission, or (3) enter a thermogravitational runaway on a very long\ntimescale of about $10^6$ years. Alternatively, a faster thermal runaway\n(timescale of about 100 years) may occur. The sources of damping considered are\nshear viscosity, hyperon bulk viscosity and boundary layer viscosity. We vary\nproprieties of the star such as the hyperon superfluid transition temperature\nT_c, the fraction of the star that is above the threshold for direct URCA\nreactions, and slippage factor, and map the different scenarios we obtain to\nranges of these parameters. For all our bound evolutions the r-mode amplitude\nremains small $\\sim 10^{-5}$. The spin frequency is limited by boundary layer\nviscosity to $\\nu_{max} \\sim 800 Hz [S_{ns}/(M_{1.4} R_6)]^{4/11} T_8^{-2/11}$.\nWe find that for $\\nu > 700$ Hz the r-mode instability would be active for\nabout 1 in 1000 LMXBs and that only the gravitational waves from LMXBs in the\nlocal group of galaxies could be detected by advanced LIGO interferometers.\n",

        "abstract": "  We present a quantum auction protocol using superpositions to represent bids\nand distributed search to identify the winner(s). Measuring the final quantum\nstate gives the auction outcome while simultaneously destroying the\nsuperposition. Thus non-winning bids are never revealed. Participants can use\nentanglement to arrange for correlations among their bids, with the assurance\nthat this entanglement is not observable by others. The protocol is useful for\ninformation hiding applications, such as partnership bidding with allocative\nexternality or concerns about revealing bidding preferences. The protocol\napplies to a variety of auction types, e.g., first or second price, and to\nauctions involving either a single item or arbitrary bundles of items (i.e.,\ncombinatorial auctions). We analyze the game-theoretical behavior of the\nquantum protocol for the simple case of a sealed-bid quantum, and show how a\nsuitably designed adiabatic search reduces the possibilities for bidders to\ngame the auction. This design illustrates how incentive rather that\ncomputational constraints affect quantum algorithm choices.\n",

        "abstract": "  In a ring of s-wave superconducting material the magnetic flux is quantized\nin units of $\\Phi_0 = \\frac{h}{2e}$. It is well known from the theory of\nJosephson junctions that if the ring is interrupted with a piece of d-wave\nmaterial, then the flux is quantized in one-half of those units due to a\nadditional phase shift of $\\pi$. We reinterpret this phenomenon in terms of\ngeometric phase.\n  We consider an idealized hetero-junction superconductor with pure s-wave and\npure d-wave electron pairs. We find, for this idealized configuration, that the\nphase shift of $\\pi$ follows from the discontinuity in the geometric phase and\nis thus a fundamental consequence of quantum mechanics.\n",

Building on recently developed equation-free methods, this\napproach numerically integrates the closure dynamics, the equations of which\nmay not even be available in closed form. Although closure dynamics introduce\nstatistical assumptions of unknown validity, they can have significant\ncomputational advantages as they typically have fewer degrees of freedom and\nmay be much less stiff than the original detailed model. The closure method can\nin principle be applied to a wide class of nonlinear problems, including\nstrongly-coupled systems (either deterministic or stochastic) for which there\nmay be no scale separation. We demonstrate the equation-free approach for\nimplementing entropy-based Eyink-Levermore closures on a nonlinear stochastic\npartial differential equation.\n",

        "abstract": "  Using numerical simulations, we investigate vortex configurations and pinning\nin superconductors with honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays. We find that a\nvariety of novel vortex crystal states can be stabilized at integer and\nfractional matching field densities. The honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays\nproduce considerably more pronounced commensuration peaks in the critical\ndepinning force than triangular pinning arrays, and also cause additional peaks\nat noninteger matching fields where a portion of the vortices are located in\nthe large interstitial regions of the pinning lattices. For the honeycomb\npinning array, we find matching effects of equal strength at most fillings\nB/B_\\phi=n/2 for n>2, where n is an integer, in agreement with recent\nexperiments. For kagome pinning arrays, pronounced matching effects generally\noccur at B/B_\\phi=n/3 for n>3, while for triangular pinning arrays pronounced\nmatching effects are observed only at integer fillings B/B_\\phi=n. At the\nnoninteger matching field peaks in the honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays, the\ninterstitial vortices are arranged in dimer, trimer, and higher order n-mer\nstates that have an overall orientational order. We call these n-mer states\n\"vortex molecular crystals\" and \"vortex plastic crystals\" since they are\nsimilar to the states recently observed in colloidal molecular crystal systems.\nWe argue that the vortex molecular crystals have properties in common with\ncertain spin systems such as Ising and n-state Potts models. We show that\nkagome and honeycomb pinning arrays can be useful for increasing the critical\ncurrent above that of purely triangular pinning arrays.\n",

The\ndifference in the ratio value comes from different characters of the Fermi\nsurfaces.

We show that electron-electron interaction strongly\naffects spin-orbit admixture in the sample. Consequently, relaxation rates\nstrongly depend on the number of carriers confined in the dot. We identify the\nmechanisms which may lead to improved spin stability in few electron (>2)\nquantum dots as compared to the usual one and two electron devices. Finally, we\ndiscuss recent experiments on triplet-singlet transitions in GaAs dots subject\nto external magnetic fields. Our simulations are in good agreement with the\nexperimental findings, and support the interpretation of the observed spin\nrelaxation as being due to spin-orbit coupling assisted by acoustic phonon\nemission.\n",

The Cr-O\ndistance is close to that in MgCr2O4, indicating a full relaxation of the first\nneighbors, and the second shell of Al atoms relaxes partially. These\nobservations demonstrate that Vegard's law is not obeyed in the MgAl2O4-MgCr2O4\nsolid solution. Despite some angular site distortion, the local D3d symmetry of\nthe B-site of the spinel structure is retained during the substitution of Cr\nfor Al. Here, we show that the relaxation is accomodated by strain-induced bond\nbuckling, with angular tilts of the Mg-centred tetrahedra around the Cr-centred\noctahedron. By contrast, there is no significant alteration of the angles\nbetween the edge-sharing octahedra, which build chains aligned along the three\nfour-fold axes of the cubic structure.\n",

The small\nperturbation g H1, however, renders the conductivity finite at finite\ntemperatures. For example, H0 could be a continuum field theory, where momentum\nis conserved, or an integrable one-dimensional model while H1 might describe\nthe effects of weak disorder. In the limit g to 0, we derive lower bounds for\nthe relevant conductivities and show how they can be improved systematically\nusing the memory matrix formalism. Furthermore, we discuss various applications\nand investigate under what conditions our lower bound may become exact.\n",

The main idea of the paper is based on the\nstatistical matching of the thermodynamical systems with the additive\nmulti-step Markov chains. This general approach is applied to the Ising spin\nchain with long-range interaction between its elements. The asymptotical\nexpressions for the energy and entropy of the system are derived for the\nlimiting case of weak interaction. These thermodynamical quantities are found\nto be non-proportional to the length of the system (number of its particle).\n",

We find a size-dependent cumulative\nadvantage for the impact of universities in terms of total number of citations.\nIn previous work a similar scaling rule was found at the level of research\ngroups. Therefore we conjecture that this scaling rule is a prevalent property\nof the science system. We observe that lower performance universities have a\nlarger size-dependent cumulative advantage for receiving citations than\ntop-performance universities. We also find that for the lower-performance\nuniversities the fraction of not-cited publications decreases considerably with\nsize. Generally, the higher the average journal impact of the publications of a\nuniversity, the lower the number of not-cited publications. We find that the\naverage research performance does not dilute with size. Large top-performance\nuniversities succeed in keeping a high performance over a broad range of\nactivities. This most probably is an indication of their scientific attractive\npower. Next we find that particularly for the lower-performance universities\nthe field citation density provides a strong cumulative advantage in citations\nper publication. The relation between number of citations and field citation\ndensity found in this study can be considered as a second basic scaling rule of\nthe science system. Top-performance universities publish in journals with\nsignificantly higher journal impact as compared to the lower performance\nuniversities. We find a significant decrease of the fraction of self-citations\nwith increasing research performance, average field citation density, and\naverage journal impact.\n",

In the random anisotropy magnets the structural\ndisorder is present in a form of local quenched anisotropy axes of random\norientation. When the anisotropy axes are randomly distributed along the edges\nof the n-dimensional hypercube, asymptotical dynamical critical properties\ncoincide with those of the random-site Ising model. However structural disorder\ngives rise to considerable effects for non-asymptotic critical dynamics. We\ninvestigate this phenomenon by a field-theoretical renormalization group\nanalysis in the two-loop order. We study critical slowing down and obtain\nquantitative estimates for the effective and asymptotic critical exponents of\nthe order parameter and scalar density. The results predict complex scenarios\nfor the effective critical exponent approaching an asymptotic regime.\n",

While for the former dynamical correlations and lifetime effects\nprevent a description in terms of quasi-particles, the excitations of the\nlatter allow for an effective band-structure. We construct an\norbital-dependent, but static one-particle potential that reproduces the full\nmany-body spectrum. Yet, the ground state is well beyond a static one-particle\ndescription. The emerging picture gives a non-trivial answer to the decade-old\nquestion of the nature of the insulator, which we characterize as a ``many-body\nPeierls'' state.\n",

        "abstract": "  For the first time we apply the methodologies of nonlinear analysis to\ninvestigate atomic matter. We use these methods in the analysis of Atomic\nWeights and of Mass Number of atomic nuclei. Using the AutoCorrelation Function\nand Mutual Information we establish the presence of nonlinear effects in the\nmechanism of increasing mass of atomic nuclei considered as a function of the\natomic number. We find that increasing mass is divergent, possibly chaotic. We\nalso investigate the possible existence of a Power Law for atomic nuclei and,\nusing also the technique of the variogram, we conclude that a fractal regime\ncould superintend to the mechanism of increasing mass for nuclei. Finally,\nusing the Hurst exponent, evidence is obtained that the mechanism of increasing\nmass in atomic nuclei is in the fractional Brownian regime. The most\ninteresting results are obtained by using Recurrence Quantification Analysis\n(RQA). New recurrences, psudoperiodicities, self-resemblance and class of\nself-similarities are identified with values of determinism showing oscillating\nvalues indicating the presence of more or less stability during the process of\nincreasing mass of atomic nuclei. In brief, new regimes of regularities are\nidentified for atomic nuclei that deserve to be studied by future researches.\nIn particular an accurate analysis of binding energy values by nonlinear\nmethods is further required.\n",

As\nan illustration of the use of our general formulae, we further show that $Z^0\n\\to \\nu + \\nu$ is forbidden for the standard or twisted coproduct of the\nPoincar\\'{e} group if the neutrino is massless, even if lepton number is not\nconserved.

We study the properties of such spin systems, and show that\ndespite the distortion, the lattice retains a great deal of frustration.\nAlthough sub-extensive, the classical ground state degeneracy remains very\nlarge, growing exponentially with the system perimeter. We consider degeneracy\nlifting by thermal and quantum fluctuations. To linear (spin wave) order, the\ndegeneracy is found to stay intact. Two complementary approaches are therefore\nintroduced, appropriate to low and high temperatures, which point to the same\nordered pattern. In the low temperature limit, an effective chirality\nHamiltonian is derived from non-linear spin waves which predicts a transition\non increasing $J'/J$, from $\\sqrt 3\\times \\sqrt 3$ type order to a new\nferrimagnetic {\\em striped chirality} order with a doubled unit cell. This is\nconfirmed by a large-N approximation on the O($n$) model on this lattice. While\nthe saddle point solution produces a line degeneracy, $O(1/n)$ corrections\nselect the non-trivial wavevector of the striped chirality state. The quantum\nlimit of spin 1/2 on this lattice is studied via exact small system\ndiagonalization and compare well with experimental results at intermediate\ntemperatures. We suggest that the very low temperature spin frozen state seen\nin NMR experiments may be related to the disconnected nature of classical\nground states on this lattice, which leads to a prediction for NMR line shapes.\n",

The model is applied to the decays of the first\nexcited $3/2^{-}$ state of $^{17}$Ne and $3/2^{-}$ ground state of $^{45}$Fe.\nVarious qualitative aspects of the model and relations with the other\nsimplified approaches to the three-body decays are discussed.\n",

The mean number of\nclusters whose size is comparable to the size of the nucleating droplet becomes\ntime independent at about the same time that the nucleation rate reaches its\nconstant value.

We report on a search for short-duration\ngravitational-wave bursts with arbitrary waveform in the 64-1600 Hz frequency\nrange appearing in all three LIGO interferometers. Signal consistency tests,\ndata quality cuts, and auxiliary-channel vetoes are applied to reduce the rate\nof spurious triggers. No gravitational-wave signals are detected in 15.5 days\nof live observation time; we set a frequentist upper limit of 0.15 per day (at\n90% confidence level) on the rate of bursts with large enough amplitudes to be\ndetected reliably. The amplitude sensitivity of the search, characterized using\nMonte Carlo simulations, is several times better than that of previous\nsearches. We also provide rough estimates of the distances at which\nrepresentative supernova and binary black hole merger signals could be detected\nwith 50% efficiency by this analysis.\n",

As doping increases, a\nlinear-in-$T$ behavior of the penetration depth, characteristic of d-wave\npairing, emerges as the lower magnetic band crosses the Fermi level and creates\na nodal Fermi surface pocket.\n",

The\nnonlinear interaction between the NMR and the STLR can be implemented by\nsetting the external biased flux of the CPB at certain values. The interaction\nHamiltonian between the NMR and the STLR is derived by performing Fr$\\rm\\ddot\no$hlich transformation on the total Hamiltonian of the combined system. Just by\nadiabatically keeping the CPB at the ground state, we get the standard\nparametric down-conversion Hamiltonian. The CPB plays the role of ``nonlinear\nmedia\", and the squeezed states of the NMR can be easily generated in a manner\nsimilar to the three-wave mixing in quantum optics. This is the three-wave\nmixing in a solid-state circuit.\n",

Given a\nbipartite Hamiltonian H coupling two finite dimensional particles A and B, the\nentangling rate is shown to be upper bounded by c*log(d)*norm(H), where d is\nthe smallest dimension of the interacting particles, norm(H) is the operator\nnorm of H, and c is a constant close to 1. Under certain restrictions on the\ninitial state we prove analogous upper bound for the ancilla-assisted\nentangling rate with a constant c that does not depend upon dimensions of local\nancillas. The restriction is that the initial state has at most two distinct\nSchmidt coefficients (each coefficient may have arbitrarily large\nmultiplicity). Our proof is based on analysis of a mixing rate -- a functional\nmeasuring how fast entropy can be produced if one mixes a time-independent\nstate with a state evolving unitarily.\n",

The state space of the\nmodel is given by all triangulations of a sphere with $n$ nodes, half of which\nare red and half are blue. Red nodes want to have 5 neighbors while blue ones\nwant 7. Energies of nodes with different numbers of neighbors are supposed to\nbe positive. The dynamics is that of flipping the diagonal of two adjacent\ntriangles, with a temperature dependent probability. We show that this system\nhas an approach to a steady state which is exponentially slow, and show that\nthe stationary state is unordered. We also study the local energy landscape and\nshow that it has the hierarchical structure known from spin glasses. Finally,\nwe show that the evolution can be described as that of a rarefied gas with\nspontaneous generation of particles and annihilating collisions.\n",

The\nintrinsic characteristics of TMs consumedly help to understand the essence of\nthe experimental T band of CNT. The anomalous pressure behavior of the TMs\nfrequencies may be originated from the tube symmetry alteration from D10h to\nD2h then to C2h.\n",

Here\nthe daemon approach is analyzed considering the positive model independent\nresult of the DAMA/NaI experiment. We explain the maximum in DAMA signals\nobserved in the May-June period to be associated with the formation behind the\nSun of a trail of daemons that the Sun captures into elongated orbits as it\nmoves to the apex. The range of significant 2-6-keV DAMA signals fits well the\niodine nuclei elastically knocked out of the NaI(Tl) scintillator by particles\nfalling on the Earth with V=30-50 km/s from strongly elongated heliocentric\norbits. The half-year periodicity of the slower daemons observed in SPb\noriginates from the transfer of particles that are deflected through ~90 deg\ninto near-Earth orbits each time the particles cross the outer reaches of the\nSun which had captured them. Their multi-loop (cross-like) trajectories\ntraverse many times the Earth's orbit in March and September, which increases\nthe probability for the particles to enter near-Earth orbits during this time.\nCorroboration of celestial mechanics calculations with observations yields\n~1e-19 cm2 for the cross section of daemon interaction with the solar matter.\n",

        "abstract": "  Environmental dielectric screening effects on exciton transition energies in\nsingle-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have been studied quantitatively in the\nrange of dielectric constants from 1.0 to 37 by immersing SWNTs bridged over\ntrenches in various organic solvents by means of photoluminescence and the\nexcitation spectroscopies. With increasing environmental dielectric constant\n($\\epsilon_{\\rm env}$), both $E_{11}$ and $E_{22}$ exhibited a redshift by\nseveral tens meV and a tendency to saturate at a $\\epsilon_{\\rm env} \\sim 5$\nwithout an indication of significant ($n$,$m$) dependence. The redshifts can be\nexplained by dielectric screening of the repulsive electron-electron\ninteraction. The $\\epsilon_{\\rm env}$ dependence of $E_{11}$ and $E_{22}$ can\nbe expressed by a simple empirical equation with a power law in $\\epsilon_{\\rm\nenv}$, $E_{\\rm ii} = E_{\\rm ii}^{\\infty} + A\\epsilon_{\\rm env}^{-\\alpha}$. We\nalso immersed a sample in sodium-dodecyl-sulfate (SDS) solution to investigate\nthe effects of wrapping SWNTs with surfactant. The resultant $E_{11}$ and\n$E_{22}$, which agree well with Weisman's data [Nano Lett. {\\bf 3}, 1235\n(2003)], are close to those of $\\epsilon_{\\rm env}$ of 2. However, in addition\nto the shift due to dielectric screening, another shift was observed so that\nthe ($2n+m$)-family patterns spread more widely, similar to that of the\nuniaxial-stress-induced shift.\n",

The ion\ncharge induces in the atom an electric dipole moment, which attracts it with an\nr^{-4} dependence at large distances. In the regime considered here, the\ncharacteristic range of the atom-ion interaction is comparable or larger than\nthe characteristic size of the trapping potential, which excludes the\napplication of the contact pseudopotential. The short-range part of the\ninteraction is described in the framework of quantum-defect theory, by\nintroducing some short-range parameters, which can be related to the s-wave\nscattering length. When the separation between traps is changed we observe\ntrap-induced shape resonances between molecular bound states and vibrational\nstates of the external trapping potential. Our analysis is extended to\nquasi-one-dimensional geometries, when the scattering exhibit\nconfinement-induced resonances, similar to the ones studied before for\nshort-range interactions. For quasi-one-dimensional systems we investigate the\neffects of coupling between the center of mass and relative motion, which\noccurs for different trapping frequencies of atom and ion traps. Finally, we\nshow how the two types of resonances can be employed for quantum state control\nand spectroscopy of atom-ion molecules.\n",

        "abstract": "  The cosmological redshift phenomenon can be described by the dark matter\nfield fluid model, the results deduced from this model agree very well with the\nobservations. The observed cosmological redshift of light depends on both the\nspeed of the emitter and the distance between the emitter and the observer. If\nthe emitter moves away from us, a redshift is observed. If the emitter moves\ntowards us, whether a redshift, a blueshift or no shift is observed will depend\non the speed vs. the distance. If the speed is in the range of\nc(exp[-beta*D]-1) < v < 0, a redshift is observed; if the speed equals\nc(exp[-beta*D]-1), no shift is observed; if the speed v less than\nc(exp[-beta*D]-1), a blueshift is observed. A redshift will be always observed\nin all directions for any celestial objects as long as their distance from us\nis large enough. Therefore, many more redshifts than blueshifts should be\nobserved for galaxies and supernovae, etc in the sky. This conclusion agrees\nwith current observations. The estimated value of the redshift constant beta of\nthe dark matter field fluid is in the range of 10^(-3) ~ 10^(-5)/Mpc. A large\nredshift value from a distant celestial object may not necessarily indicate\nthat it has a large receding speed. Based on the redshift effect of dark matter\nfield fluid, it is concluded that at least in time average all photons have the\nsame geometry (size and shape) in all inertial reference frames and do not have\nlength contraction effect.\n",

Further, in\na periodically repeating universe, these outcomes must be pre-recorded within\nthe non-physical conscious observers, which precludes free will. Free will\nhowever exists in a universe with open time, It is suggested that psychology's\nbinding problem is connected with Cantor's original definition of set.\nInfluence of consciousness on material outcome through quantum processes is\ndiscussed and interesting constraints derived. For example, it is predicted\nthat quantum mechanical brain states should get frozen if monitored at\nsufficiently small space-time intervals - a neuro-biological version of the so\ncalled quantum zeno effect, which has been verified in domain of micro-physics.\nExistence of a very small micro-mini-black-hole in brain is predicted as a\nspace-time structural interface between consciousness and brain, whose\nvaporization explains mass-loss reported in weighing experiments, conducting\nduring the moments of death.\n",

The specific heats and nearest-neighbor spin-spin\ncorrelations are calculated thoughout the entire temperature and anisotropy\nranges in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regions, obtaining a global\ndescription and quantitative results. We obtain, for all anisotropies, the\nantiferromagnetic spin-liquid spin-wave velocity and the Isinglike\nferromagnetic excitation spectrum gap, exhibiting the spin-wave to spinon\ncrossover. A number of characteristics of purely quantum nature are found: The\nin-plane interaction s_i^x s_j^x + s_i^y s_j^y induces an antiferromagnetic\ncorrelation in the out-of-plane s_i^z component, at higher temperatures in the\nantiferromagnetic XXZ chain, dominantly at low temperatures in the\nferromagnetic XXZ chain, and, in-between, at all temperatures in the XY chain.\nWe find that the converse effect also occurs in the antiferromagnetic XXZ\nchain: an antiferromagnetic s_i^z s_j^z interaction induces a correlation in\nthe s_i^xy component. As another purely quantum effect, (i) in the\nantiferromagnet, the value of the specific heat peak is insensitive to\nanisotropy and the temperature of the specific heat peak decreases from the\nisotropic (Heisenberg) with introduction of either type (Ising or XY)\nanisotropy; (ii) in complete contrast, in the ferromagnet, the value and\ntemperature of the specific heat peak increase with either type of anisotropy.\n",

It is suggested that at x* the Fermi level touches the bottom of the\na1g band at the gamma point, leading to a crucial change in the density of\nstates across x* and the emergence of a small electron pocket around the gamma\npoint for x > x*.\n",

However, when\nrealistic values of photon loss are considered its fidelity is significantly\nreduced. Here we consider the use of measurement based quantum processing\ntechniques to enhance the operation of the Zeno gate. With the help of quantum\nteleportation, we show that it is possible to achieve a Zeno CNOT gate (GC-Zeno\ngate) that gives (near) unit fidelity and moderate probability of success of\n0.76 with a one-photon to two-photon transmission ratio $\\kappa=10^4$. We\ninclude some mode-mismatch effects and estimate the bounds on the mode overlap\nand $\\kappa$ for which fault tolerant operation would be possible.\n",

        "abstract": "  We propose an extension of the principle of virtual work of mechanics to\nrandom dynamics of mechanical systems. The total virtual work of the\ninteracting forces and inertial forces on every particle of the system is\ncalculated by considering the motion of each particle. Then according to the\nprinciple of Lagrange-d'Alembert for dynamical equilibrium, the vanishing\nensemble average of the virtual work gives rise to the thermodynamic\nequilibrium state with maximization of thermodynamic entropy. This approach\nestablishes a close relationship between the maximum entropy approach for\nstatistical mechanics and a fundamental principle of mechanics, and constitutes\nan attempt to give the maximum entropy approach, considered by many as only an\ninference principle based on the subjectivity of probability and entropy, the\nstatus of fundamental physics law.\n",

Other harmonics will affect the\nsignal-to-noise ratio of systems currently believed to be observable by LISA.\nMore significantly, inclusion of other harmonics in our matched filters would\nmean that more massive systems that were previously thought to be {\\it not}\nvisible in LISA should be detectable with reasonable SNRs. Our estimates show\nthat we should be able to significantly increase the mass reach of LISA and\nobserve the more commonly occurring supermassive black holes of masses $\\sim\n10^8M_\\odot.$ More specifically, with the inclusion of all known harmonics LISA\nwill be able to observe even supermassive black hole coalescences with total\nmass $\\sim 10^8 M_\\odot (10^9M_\\odot)$ (and mass-ratio 0.1) for a low frequency\ncut-off of $10^{-4}{\\rm Hz}$ $(10^{-5}{\\rm Hz})$ with an SNR up to $\\sim 60$\n$(\\sim 30)$ at a distance of 3 Gpc. This is important from the astrophysical\nviewpoint since observational evidence for the existence of black holes in this\nmass range is quite strong and binaries containing such supermassive black\nholes will be inaccessible to LISA if one uses as detection templates only the\ndominant harmonic.\n",

This notion allows for a proper\ndescription of statistical systems, avoiding inconsistencies in theory. As an\nillustration, a Bose-condensed system is considered. It is shown that a\nself-consistent treatment of the latter, using a representative ensemble,\nalways yields a conserving and gapless theory.\n",

In a similar\nsense, weak additivity is shown to imply strong additivity for any convex\nentanglement monotone.

The former description implies that changing trading\nfrequency should alter the characteristic time of the phenomenon. This is not\ntrue for the empirical data: The Epps curves do not scale with market activity.\nThe latter result indicates that the time scale of the phenomenon is connected\nto the reaction time of market participants (this we denote as human time\nscale), independent of market activity. In this paper we give a new description\nof the Epps effect through the decomposition of cross-correlations. After\ntesting our method on a model of generated random walk price changes we justify\nour analytical results by fitting the Epps curves of real world data.\n",

        "abstract": "  The recent parity-violating $ep$ forward-scattering elastic asymmetry data\nfrom Jefferson Lab (HAPPEx and G0), when combined with the $\\nu p$ elastic\ncross section data from Brookhaven (E734), permit an extraction of the\nstrangeness contribution to the vector and axial nucleon form factors for\nmomentum transfers in the range $0.45 < Q^2 < 1.0$ GeV$^2$. These results,\ncombined with the recent determination of the strange vector form factors at\n$Q^2 = 0.1$ GeV$^2$ (SAMPLE, HAPPEx, PVA4, G0) have been interpreted in terms\nof $uuds\\bar{s}$ configurations very different from the kaon-loop\nconfigurations usually associated with strangeness in the nucleon. New\nexperiments are being proposed to improve the state of our knowledge of the\n$\\nu p$ elastic cross section -- these new experiments will push the range of\n$Q^2$ to much lower values, and greatly increase the precision of the $\\nu p$\nelastic data. One outcome of this can be a measurement of the strangeness\ncontribution to the nucleon spin, $\\Delta s$. Nuclear targets (e.g. C or Ar)\nare to be used in these neutrino experiments, and so a deep understanding of\nthe nuclear physics, particularly in regard to final state effects, is needed\nbefore the potential of these precision experiments can be fully realized.\n",

This\nubiquitous trait seems to increase motivation and persistence, and is probably\nevolutionarily adaptive. But how good really is our ability to control? How\nsuccessful is our track record in these areas? There is little understanding of\nwhen and under what circumstances we may over-estimate or even lose our ability\nto control and optimize outcomes, especially when they are the result of\naggregations of individual optimization processes. Here, we demonstrate\nanalytically using the theory of Markov Chains and by numerical simulations in\ntwo classes of games, the Minority game and the Parrondo Games, that agents who\noptimize their strategy based on past information actually perform worse than\nnon-optimizing agents. In other words, low-entropy (more informative)\nstrategies under-perform high-entropy (or random) strategies. This provides a\nprecise definition of the \"illusion of control\" in set-ups a priori defined to\nemphasize the importance of optimization.\n",

        "abstract": "  The two-dimensional kinetic Ising model, when exposed to an oscillating\napplied magnetic field, has been shown to exhibit a nonequilibrium,\nsecond-order dynamic phase transition (DPT), whose order parameter Q is the\nperiod-averaged magnetization. It has been established that this DPT falls in\nthe same universality class as the equilibrium phase transition in the\ntwo-dimensional Ising model in zero applied field. Here we study for the first\ntime the scaling of the dynamic order parameter with respect to a nonzero,\nperiod-averaged, magnetic `bias' field, H_b, for a DPT produced by a\nsquare-wave applied field. We find evidence that the scaling exponent,\n\\delta_d, of H_b at the critical period of the DPT is equal to the exponent for\nthe critical isotherm, \\delta_e, in the equilibrium Ising model. This implies\nthat H_b is a significant component of the field conjugate to Q. A finite-size\nscaling analysis of the dynamic order parameter above the critical period\nprovides further support for this result. We also demonstrate numerically that,\nfor a range of periods and values of H_b in the critical region, a\nfluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR), with an effective temperature\nT_{eff}(T, P, H_0) depending on the period, and possibly the temperature and\nfield amplitude, holds for the variables Q and H_b. This FDR justifies the use\nof the scaled variance of Q as a proxy for the nonequilibrium susceptibility,\n\\partial<Q> / \\partial H_b, in the critical region.\n",

Numerical calculations of\nindicatrices for several aspect ratios and volumes of RBC have been carried\nout. Comparison of the simulated indicatrices and indicatrices measured by SFC\nshowed good agreement, validating the biconcave disk model for a mature RBC. We\nsimulated the light-scattering output signals from the SFC with the DDA for\nRBCs modeled as a disk-sphere and as an oblate spheroid. The biconcave disk,\nthe disk-sphere, and the oblate spheroid models have been compared for two\norientations, i.e. face-on and rim-on incidence.

The main new effect is an underlying lattice which\nis being refined during dynamical changes of the volume. In general, this leads\nto a new feature of dynamical difference equations which may not have constant\nstep-size, posing new mathematical problems. It is discussed how such models\ncan be evaluated and what lattice refinements imply for semiclassical behavior.\nTwo detailed examples illustrate that stability conditions can put strong\nconstraints on suitable refinement models, even in the absence of a fundamental\nHamiltonian which defines changes of the underlying lattice. Thus, a large\nclass of consistency tests of loop quantum gravity becomes available. In this\ncontext, it will also be seen that quantum corrections due to inverse powers of\nmetric components in a constraint are much larger than they appeared recently\nin more special treatments of isotropic, free scalar models where they were\nartificially suppressed.\n",

        "abstract": "  It is known that when hard spheres are added to a pure system of hard rods\nthe stability of the smectic phase may be greatly enhanced, and that this\neffect can be rationalised in terms of depletion forces. In the present paper\nwe first study the effect of orientational order on depletion forces in this\nparticular binary system, comparing our results with those obtained adopting\nthe usual approximation of considering the rods parallel and their orientations\nfrozen. We consider mixtures with rods of different aspect ratios and spheres\nof different diameters, and we treat them within Onsager theory. Our results\nindicate that depletion effects, and consequently smectic stability, decrease\nsignificantly as a result of orientational disorder in the smectic phase when\ncompared with corresponding data based on the frozen--orientation\napproximation. These results are discussed in terms of the $\\tau$ parameter,\nwhich has been proposed as a convenient measure of depletion strength. We\npresent closed expressions for $\\tau$, and show that it is intimately connected\nwith the depletion potential. We then analyse the effect of particle geometry\nby comparing results pertaining to systems of parallel rods of different shapes\n(spherocylinders, cylinders and parallelepipeds). We finally provide results\nbased on the Zwanzig approximation of a Fundamental--Measure\ndensity--functional theory applied to mixtures of parallelepipeds and cubes of\ndifferent sizes. In this case, we show that the $\\tau$ parameter exhibits a\nlinear asymptotic behaviour in the limit of large values of the hard--rod\naspect ratio, in conformity with Onsager theory, as well as in the limit of\nlarge values of the ratio of rod breadth to cube side length, $d$, in contrast\nto Onsager approximation, which predicts $\\tau\\sim d^3$.\n",

We first show\nhow system-size stochastic resonance arises naturally in this framework, and\nthen how the phenomenon of array-enhanced stochastic resonance can be further\nenhanced by letting the diffusion coefficient depend on the field. A yet less\ntrivial generalization is exemplified by a stylized version of the\nFitzHugh-Nagumo system, a paradigm of the activator-inhibitor class. After\ndiscussing for this system the second aspect enumerated above, we derive from\nit -through an adiabatic-like elimination of the inhibitor field- an effective\nscalar model that includes a nonlocal contribution. Studying the role played by\nthe range of the nonlocal kernel and its effect on stochastic resonance, we\nfind an optimal range that maximizes the system's response.\n",

The GW pulse is distorted by the gravitational effect of the\nself-energy residing in between these shells. We illustrate this distortion for\nGW pulses from the final plunge of black hole (BH) binaries, leading to the\nevolution of the GW profile as a function of the radial distance from the\nsource. The distortion depends on the total GW energy released and the duration\nof the emission, scaled by the total binary mass, M. The effect should be\nrelevant in finite box simulations where the waveforms are extracted within a\nradius of <~ 100M. For characteristic emission parameters at the final plunge\nbetween binary BHs of arbitrary spins, this effect could distort the simulated\nGW templates for LIGO and LISA by a fraction of 0.001. Accounting for the wave\ndistortion would significantly decrease the waveform extraction errors in\nnumerical simulations.\n",

        "abstract": "  I discuss fundamental limits placed on information and information processing\nby gravity. Such limits arise because both information and its processing\nrequire energy, while gravitational collapse (formation of a horizon or black\nhole) restricts the amount of energy allowed in a finite region. Specifically,\nI use a criterion for gravitational collapse called the hoop conjecture. Once\nthe hoop conjecture is assumed a number of results can be obtained directly:\nthe existence of a fundamental uncertainty in spatial distance of order the\nPlanck length, bounds on information (entropy) in a finite region, and a bound\non the rate of information processing in a finite region. In the final section\nI discuss some cosmological issues related to the total amount of information\nin the universe, and note that almost all detailed aspects of the late universe\nare determined by the randomness of quantum outcomes. This paper is based on a\ntalk presented at a 2007 Bellairs Research Institute (McGill University)\nworkshop on black holes and quantum information.\n",

        "abstract": "  The local, uncorrelated multiplicative noises driving a second-order, purely\nnoise-induced, ordering phase transition (NIPT) were assumed to be Gaussian and\nwhite in the model of [Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{73}, 3395 (1994)]. The\npotential scientific and technological interest of this phenomenon calls for a\nstudy of the effects of the noises' statistics and spectrum. This task is\nfacilitated if these noises are dynamically generated by means of stochastic\ndifferential equations (SDE) driven by white noises. One such case is that of\nOrnstein--Uhlenbeck noises which are stationary, with Gaussian pdf and a\nvariance reduced by the self-correlation time (\\tau), and whose effect on the\nNIPT phase diagram has been studied some time ago. Another such case is when\nthe stationary pdf is a (colored) Tsallis' (q)--\\emph{Gaussian} which, being a\n\\emph{fat-tail} distribution for (q>1) and a \\emph{compact-support} one for\n(q<1), allows for a controlled exploration of the effects of the departure from\nGaussian statistics. As done before with stochastic resonance and other\nphenomena, we now exploit this tool to study--within a simple mean-field\napproximation and with an emphasis on the \\emph{order parameter} and the\n``\\emph{susceptibility}''--the combined effect on NIPT of the noises'\nstatistics and spectrum. Even for relatively small (\\tau), it is shown that\nwhereas fat-tail noise distributions ((q>1)) counteract the effect of\nself-correlation, compact-support ones ((q<1)) enhance it. Also, an interesting\neffect on the susceptibility is seen in the last case.\n",

It allows one to solve explicitly for the\nsynchronization order parameter and the critical point of 1) the full\nphase-locking transition for a system with a finite number of oscillators\n(unlike the original Kuramoto model, which is solvable implicitly only in the\nmean-field limit) and 2) a new class of continuum systems. It also makes it\npossible to probe the system's dynamics as it moves towards a steady state.\nWhile discussion in this paper is restricted to systems with global coupling,\nthe new formalism introduced by the linear reformulation also lends itself to\nsolving systems that exhibit local or asymmetric coupling.\n",

We found that the deviation of the vacuum refractive index\nis composed of two parts: one is caused by the time dilation effect, the other\nis caused by the length contraction effect. As an application, we simulated the\neffect of the gravitational lensing through computer programming and found that\nthe missing central imaging could be interpreted in a reasonable way.\n",

At high\ntemperature, the phase is incommensurate with $\\bf{k}$=(1/2, 1/2, 0.298) and a\npossible small ellipticity.

Frustration of the spin-chains is\nexpected for the proposed antiferromagnetic ordering at low temperatures.\nHowever, the band calculations show that the experimental room temperature\ncrystal structure is incompatible with antiferromagnetism. Both the intrachain\nand interchain coupling is found to be ferromagnetic.\n",

        "abstract": "  A classical problem in elasticity theory involves an inhomogeneity embedded\nin a material of given stress and shear moduli. The inhomogeneity is a region\nof arbitrary shape whose stress and shear moduli differ from those of the\nsurrounding medium. In this paper we present a new, semi-analytic method for\nfinding the stress tensor for an infinite plate with such an inhomogeneity. The\nsolution involves two conformal maps, one from the inside and the second from\nthe outside of the unit circle to the inside, and respectively outside, of the\ninhomogeneity. The method provides a solution by matching the conformal maps on\nthe boundary between the inhomogeneity and the surrounding material. This\nmatching converges well only for relatively mild distortions of the unit circle\ndue to reasons which will be discussed in the article. We provide a comparison\nof the present result to known previous results.\n",

The goal of this chapter is to give an\noverview of the recent advances made for binary granular gases by using kinetic\ntheory tools. Some of the results presented here cover aspects such as\ntransport properties, energy nonequipartition, instabilities, segregation or\nmixing, non-Newtonian behavior, .... In addition, comparison of the analytical\nresults with those obtained from Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations\nis also carried out, showing the reliability of kinetic theory to describe\ngranular flows even for strong dissipation.\n",

We describe the shock detection diagnostics necessary for\nthis numerical study, and verify them against theoretical shocking predictions\nfor the dispersionless case. These predictions show Carrier Envelope Phase\n(CEP) and pulse bandwidth sensitivity in the single-cycle regime. The flexible\ndispersion management offered by PSSD enables us to independently control the\nlinear and nonlinear dispersion. Customized dispersion profiles allow us to\nanalyze the development of both carrier self-steepening and shocks. The results\nexhibit a marked asymmetry between normal and anomalous dispersion, both in the\nlimits of the shocking regime and in the (near) shocked pulse waveforms.\nCombining these insights, we offer some suggestions on how carrier shocking (or\nat least extreme self-steepening) might be realised experimentally.\n",

Here we analyze the world network of bilateral\ntrade imbalances and characterize its overall flux organization, unraveling\nlocal and global high-flux pathways that define the backbone of the trade\nsystem. We develop a general procedure capable to progressively filter out in a\nconsistent and quantitative way the dominant trade channels. This procedure is\ncompletely general and can be applied to any weighted network to detect the\nunderlying structure of transport flows. The trade fluxes properties of the\nworld trade web determines a ranking of trade partnerships that highlights\nglobal interdependencies, providing information not accessible by simple local\nanalysis. The present work provides new quantitative tools for a dynamical\napproach to the propagation of economic crises.\n",

However, in order to achieve an essentially\nperfect fit to the scattering data, characterized by a chi2/Ndata ~ 1, previous\npotentials have abandoned a pure one boson-exchange mechanism (OBE). Using a\ncovariant theory, we have found a OBE potential that fits the 2006 world np\ndata below 350 MeV with a chi2/Ndata = 1.06 for 3788 data. Our potential has\nfewer adjustable parameters than previous high-precision potentials, and also\nreproduces the experimental triton binding energy without introducing\nadditional irreducible three-nucleon forces.\n",

We find a strong correlation between the small and the\nlarge particle distributions so that while both partial contributions to the\nfill factor fluctuate widely, the variance of the total fill factor remains\nrelatively small. The variances of partial contributions themselves are quite\ndifferent between the smaller and the larger particles, with the larger\nparticle distribution being more correlated. The disparity in fluctuations of\npartial fill factors increases with the particle size ratio. The additional\nvariance in the partial contribution of smaller particle originates from the\nfluctuations in the size of gaps between larger particles. We discuss the\nimplications of our results to semiconductor high-energy gamma detectors where\nthe detector energy resolution is controlled by correlations in the cascade\nenergy branching process.\n",

It is shown that this alloy\nheats up with the application of a magnetic field around the Curie point due to\nthe conventional magnetocaloric effect. In contrast, the inverse magnetocaloric\neffect associated with the martensitic transition results in the unusual\ndecrease of temperature by adiabatic magnetization. We also provide\nmagnetization and specific heat data which enable to compare the measured\ntemperature changes to the values indirectly computed from thermodynamic\nrelationships. Good agreement is obtained for the conventional effect at the\nsecond-order paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition. However, at the first\norder structural transition the measured values at high fields are lower than\nthe computed ones. Irreversible thermodynamics arguments are given to show that\nsuch a discrepancy is due to the irreversibility of the first-order martensitic\ntransition.\n",

The dependence of\nstructural instabilities on magnetic ordering can be understood in terms of how\nsuper-exchange interactions depend on the Cr-O-Cr bond angles and Cr-O bond\nlengths. We demonstrate how adequate buckling of Cr-O-Cr chains can favour\nferromagnetism.

        "abstract": "  We present numerical studies for finitely extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE)\ndumbbells which are dispersed in a turbulent plane shear flow at moderate\nReynolds number. The polymer ensemble is described on the mesoscopic level by a\nset of stochastic ordinary differential equations with Brownian noise. The\ndynamics of the Newtonian solvent is determined by the Navier-Stokes equations.\nMomentum transfer of the dumbbells with the solvent is implemented by an\nadditional volume forcing term in the Navier-Stokes equations, such that both\ncomponents of the resulting viscoelastic fluid are connected by a two-way\ncoupling. The dynamics of the dumbbells is given then by Newton's second law of\nmotion including small inertia effects. We investigate the dynamics of the flow\nfor different degrees of dumbbell elasticity and inertia, as given by\nWeissenberg and Stokes numbers, respectively. For the parameters accessible in\nour study, the magnitude of the feedback of the polymers on the macroscopic\nproperties of turbulence remains small as quantified by the global energy\nbudget and the Reynolds stresses. A reduction of the turbulent drag by up to\n20% is observed for the larger particle inertia. The angular statistics of the\ndumbbells shows an increasing alignment with the mean flow direction for both,\nincreasing elasticity and inertia. This goes in line with a growing asymmetry\nof the probability density function of the transverse derivative of the\nstreamwise turbulent velocity component. We find that dumbbells get stretched\nreferentially in regions where vortex stretching or bi-axial strain dominate\nthe local dynamics and topology of the velocity gradient tensor.\n",

This is in contrast with the more\ntraditional circuit model which is based on unitary operations. Among\nmeasurement-based quantum computation methods, the recently introduced one-way\nquantum computer stands out as fundamental.\n  We develop a rigorous mathematical model underlying the one-way quantum\ncomputer and present a concrete syntax and operational semantics for programs,\nwhich we call patterns, and an algebra of these patterns derived from a\ndenotational semantics. More importantly, we present a calculus for reasoning\nlocally and compositionally about these patterns.\n  We present a rewrite theory and prove a general standardization theorem which\nallows all patterns to be put in a semantically equivalent standard form.\nStandardization has far-reaching consequences: a new physical architecture\nbased on performing all the entanglement in the beginning, parallelization by\nexposing the dependency structure of measurements and expressiveness theorems.\n  Furthermore we formalize several other measurement-based models:\nTeleportation, Phase and Pauli models and present compositional embeddings of\nthem into and from the one-way model. This allows us to transfer all the theory\nwe develop for the one-way model to these models. This shows that the framework\nwe have developed has a general impact on measurement-based computation and is\nnot just particular to the one-way quantum computer.\n",

Using the cavity method, we present a detailed and systematic analytical\nstudy of the space of proper colorings (solutions).\n  We show that for a fixed number of colors and as the average vertex degree\n(number of constraints) increases, the set of solutions undergoes several phase\ntransitions similar to those observed in the mean field theory of glasses.\nFirst, at the clustering transition, the entropically dominant part of the\nphase space decomposes into an exponential number of pure states so that beyond\nthis transition a uniform sampling of solutions becomes hard. Afterward, the\nspace of solutions condenses over a finite number of the largest states and\nconsequently the total entropy of solutions becomes smaller than the annealed\none. Another transition takes place when in all the entropically dominant\nstates a finite fraction of nodes freezes so that each of these nodes is\nallowed a single color in all the solutions inside the state. Eventually, above\nthe coloring threshold, no more solutions are available. We compute all the\ncritical connectivities for Erdos-Renyi and regular random graphs and determine\ntheir asymptotic values for large number of colors.\n  Finally, we discuss the algorithmic consequences of our findings. We argue\nthat the onset of computational hardness is not associated with the clustering\ntransition and we suggest instead that the freezing transition might be the\nrelevant phenomenon. We also discuss the performance of a simple local Walk-COL\nalgorithm and of the belief propagation algorithm in the light of our results.\n",

        "abstract": "  It has been established that local lattice spin Hamiltonians can be used for\nuniversal adiabatic quantum computation. However, the 2-local model\nHamiltonians used in these proofs are general and hence do not limit the types\nof interactions required between spins. To address this concern, the present\npaper provides two simple model Hamiltonians that are of practical interest to\nexperimentalists working towards the realization of a universal adiabatic\nquantum computer. The model Hamiltonians presented are the simplest known\nQMA-complete 2-local Hamiltonians. The 2-local Ising model with 1-local\ntransverse field which has been realized using an array of technologies, is\nperhaps the simplest quantum spin model but is unlikely to be universal for\nadiabatic quantum computation. We demonstrate that this model can be rendered\nuniversal and QMA-complete by adding a tunable 2-local transverse XX coupling.\nWe also show the universality and QMA-completeness of spin models with only\n1-local Z and X fields and 2-local ZX interactions.\n",

The diameter of the\ncore region was extracted directly from the PDF data and is in good agreement\nwith the diameter obtained from standard characterization methods suggesting\nthat there is little surface amorphous region. A compressive strain was\nmeasured in the Cd-Se bond length that increases with decreasing particle size\nbeing 0.5% with respect to bulk CdSe for the 2 nm diameter particles.

The\nexclusive probing of the extra dimensions makes a substantial difference,\nallowing for the construction of a non-constrained canonical theory. The\nquantum states of the brane-world geometry are defined by the\nTomonaga-Schwinger equation, whose integrability conditions are determined by\nthe classical perturbations of submanifolds contained in the Nash's\ndifferentiable embedding theorem. In principle, quantum brane-world theory can\nbe tested by current experiments in astrophysics and by near future laboratory\nexperiments at Tev energy. The implications to the black-hole information loss\nproblem, to the accelerating cosmology, and to a quantum mathematical theory of\nfour-sub manifolds are briefly commented.\n",

The isospin\nchemical potential is obtained by giving a vev to the time component of the\nnon-Abelian gauge field on the brane. The fluctuations of the non-Abelian gauge\nfield on the brane are dual to the SU(2) flavor current in the field theory.\nFor the embedding corresponding to vanishing quark mass, we calculate all Green\nfunctions corresponding to the components of the flavor current correlator. We\ndiscuss the physical properties of these Green functions, which go beyond\nlinear response theory. In particular, we show that the isospin chemical\npotential leads to a frequency-dependent isospin diffusion coefficient.\n",

The bi-orthogonal eigenvectors of a diagonalizable matrix are\nPuiseux-expanded in terms of the root vectors at the EP. It is shown that the\napparent contradiction between the two incompatible normalization conditions\nwith finite and singular behavior in the EP-limit can be resolved by\nprojectively extending the original Hilbert space. The complementary\nnormalization conditions correspond then to two different affine charts of this\nenlarged projective Hilbert space. Geometric phase and phase jump behavior are\nanalyzed and the usefulness of the phase rigidity as measure for the distance\nto EP configurations is demonstrated. Finally, EP-related aspects of\nPT-symmetrically extended Quantum Mechanics are discussed and a conjecture\nconcerning the quantum brachistochrone problem is formulated.\n",

        "abstract": "  We construct a class of analytic solutions with two free parameters to the\nfive-dimensional Einstein field equations, which represents the collision of\ntwo timelike 3-branes. We study the local and global properties of the\nspacetime, and find that spacelike singularities generically develop after the\ncollision, due to the mutual focus of the two branes. Non-singular spacetime\ncan be constructed only in the case where both of the two branes violate the\nenergy conditions.\n",

The calculated binding energy\nof the nucleobases shows the following hierarchy: G > T ~ C ~ A > U, with the\nequilibrium configuration being very similar for all five of them. Our results\nclearly demonstrate that the nucleobases exhibit significantly different\ninteraction strengths when physisorbed on graphene. The stabilizing factor in\nthe interaction between the base molecule and graphene sheet is dominated by\nthe molecular polarizability that allows a weakly attractive dispersion force\nto be induced between them. The present study represents a significant step\ntowards a first-principles understanding of how the base sequence of DNA can\naffect its interaction with carbon nanotubes, as observed experimentally.\n",

The calculation is performed using\nthe Lorentz integral transform method along with the {\\em ab initio} no-core\nshell model approach. An important feature of the present study is the\nconsistency of the NN and NNN interactions and also, through the Siegert\ntheorem, of the two- and three-body current operators. This is due to the\napplication of the $\\chi$EFT framework. The inclusion of the NNN interaction\nproduces a suppression of the low-energy peak and enhancement of the\nhigh-energy tail of the cross section. We compare to calculations obtained\nusing other interactions and to representative experiments. The rather confused\nexperimental situation in the giant resonance region prevents discrimination\namong different interaction models.\n",

In order to see how well the\nestimated models capture the temporal dependence of the data, we estimate and\ncompare the scaling exponents $H(q)$ (for $q = 1, 2$) for both empirical data\nand simulated data of the estimated MSM models. In most cases the multifractal\nmodel appears to generate `apparent' long memory in agreement with the\nempirical scaling laws.\n",

        "abstract": "  It has been shown that, for the two-qubit Heisenberg XY model, anisotropy and\nmagnetic field may together be used to produce entanglement for any finite\ntemperature by adjusting the external magnetic field beyond some finite\ncritical strength. This interesting result arises from an analysis employing\nthe Wootters concurrence, a computable measure of entanglement for two-qubit\nstates. Recently, Mintert {\\em et al.} proposed generalizations of Wootters\nconcurrence for multipartite states. These MKB concurrences possess a\nmathematical property that enables one to understand the origin of this\ncharacteristic behavior. Here, we first study the effect of anisotropy and\nmagnetic field on the multipartite thermal entanglement of a four-qubit\nHeisenberg XY chain using the MKB concurrences. We show that this model\nexhibits characteristic behavior similar to that of the two-qubit model. In\naddition, we show that this can again be understood using the same mathematical\nproperty. Next, we show that the six-qubit Heisenberg XY chain possesses\nproperties necessary for it to have the characteristic behavior too. Most\nimportantly, it is possible to directly measure the multipartite MKB\nconcurrences of pure states. This may provide an experimental verification of\nour conjecture that for a Heisenberg XY chain of any even number of qubits, it\nis always possible to obtain non-zero genuine multipartite entanglement at any\nfinite temperature by applying a sufficiently large magnetic field.\n",

The impracticality is attributed to the decrease of entanglement\nby local operations in the DC method. We show that, even in 2--qubit systems,\nthere exist states whose entangled property the DC method never evaluates. The\nclass of such states in 2--qubit systems is completely characterized by the\nvalue of the fully entangled fraction. Actually, a state whose fully entangled\nfraction is less than or equal to 1/2 is always transformed into a separable\nstate by local operations in the DC method, even if it has negative partial\ntransposition.\n",

As an application, we study the Mott\ntransition from a paramagnetic metal into a non-magnetic Peierls, or\nvalence-bond, Mott insulator. We analyze this model by means of our Gutzwiller\nwavefunction analytically in the limit of large coordination lattices, where we\nfind that: (1) the Mott transition is first order; (2) the Peierls gap is large\nin the Mott insulator, although it is mainly contributed by the electron\nrepulsion; (3) singlet-superconductivity arises around the transition.\n",

        "abstract": "  In the canonical formalism of statistical physics, a signature of a first\norder phase transition for finite systems is the bimodal distribution of an\norder parameter. Previous thermodynamical studies of nuclear sources produced\nin heavy-ion collisions provide information which support the existence of a\nphase transition in those finite nuclear systems. Some results suggest that the\nobservable Z1 (charge of the biggest fragment) can be considered as a reliable\norder parameter of the transition. This talk will show how from peripheral\ncollisions studied with the INDRA detector at GSI we can obtain this bimodal\nbehaviour of Z1. Getting rid of the entrance channel effects and under the\nconstraint of an equiprobable distribution of excitation energy (E*), we use\nthe canonical description of a phase transition to link this bimodal behaviour\nwith the residual convexity of the entropy. Theoretical (with and without phase\ntransition) and experimental Z1-E* correlations are compared. This comparison\nallows us to rule out the case without transition. Moreover that quantitative\ncomparison provides us with information about the coexistence region in the\nZ1-E* plane which is in good agreement with that obtained with the signal of\nabnormal uctuations of configurational energy (microcanonical negative heat\ncapacity).\n",

Starting only with the near horizon\ngeometry, Sen's entropy functional formalism computes the entropy of an extreme\nblack hole by means of a Legendre transformation where the electric fields are\ndefined as conjugated variables to the electric charges. However, traditional\nEuclidean methods require the knowledge of the full geometry to compute the\nblack hole thermodynamic quantities. We establish the connection between the\nentropy functional formalism and the standard Euclidean formalism taken at zero\ntemperature. We find that Sen's entropy function 'f' (on-shell) matches the\nzero temperature limit of the Euclidean action. Moreover, Sen's near horizon\nangular and electric fields agree with the chemical potentials that are defined\nfrom the zero-temperature limit of the Euclidean formalism.\n",

By using the time-like gluon density\n(or scalar gluon density) as an independent degree of freedom - instead of the\ntemperature $T$ as a Lagrange parameter - variations of the potential energy\ndensity lead to effective mean-fields for time-like gluons and an effective\ngluon-gluon interaction strength at low density. The latter yields a simple\ndynamical picture for the gluon fusion to color neutral glueballs when\napproaching the phase boundary from a temperature higher than $T_c$ and paves\nthe way for an off-shell transport theoretical description of the parton\ndynamics.\n",

        "abstract": "  Ebert et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 77, 3827 (1996)] have fractured icosahedral\nAl-Mn-Pd single crystals in ultrahigh vacuum and have investigated the cleavage\nplanes in-situ by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Globular patterns in the\nSTM-images were interpreted as clusters of atoms. These are significant\nstructural units of quasicrystals. The experiments of Ebert et al. imply that\nthey are also stable physical entities, a property controversially discussed\ncurrently. For a clarification we performed the first large scale fracture\nsimulations on three-dimensional complex binary systems. We studied the\npropagation of mode I cracks in an icosahedral model quasicrystal by molecular\ndynamics techniques at low temperature. In particular we examined how the shape\nof the cleavage plane is influenced by the clusters inherent in the model and\nhow it depends on the plane structure. Brittle fracture with no indication of\ndislocation activity is observed. The crack surfaces are rough on the scale of\nthe clusters, but exhibit constant average heights for orientations\nperpendicular to high symmetry axes. From detailed analyses of the fractured\nsamples we conclude that both, the plane structure and the clusters, strongly\ninfluence dynamic fracture in quasicrystals and that the clusters therefore\nhave to be regarded as physical entities.\n",

This structure and a similar 3x1\nrecontruction have been observed for many Alkali-Earth and Rare-Earth metals on\nthe Si(111) surface. Our ab initio calculations show that there are two almost\ndegenerate sites for the Sm atom in the unit cell and the LEED I-V analysis\nreveals that an admixture of the two in a ratio that slightly favours the site\nwith the lower energy is the best match to experiment. We show that the I-V\ncurves are insensitive to the presence of the Sm atom and that this results in\na very low intensity for the half order spots which might explain the\nappearance of a 3x1 LEED pattern produced by all of the structures with a 3x2\nunit cell.\n",

For a non-interacting metal, it is known\nthat the derivative of the photo-assisted noise has a staircase behavior. In\nthe presence of Coulomb interactions, we show that the photo-assisted noise\npresents a more complex profile, in particular for the two following systems:\n1) a two-dimensional electron gas in the fractional quantum Hall regime for\nwhich we have obtained evenly spaced singularities in the noise derivative,\nwith a spacing related to the filling factor and, 2) a carbon nanotube for\nwhich a smoothed staircase in the noise derivative is obtained.\n",

With the method we can interpret\nmicrostructures observed with electron microscopy as phasonic phase boundaries.\nFurthermore we determine the metadislocations of lowest energy and relate them\nuniquely to experimentally observed ones. Since moving metadislocations in the\nxi'-phase can create new phason-planes, we suggest a dislocation induced phase\ntransition from xi' to xi'_n. The methods developed in this paper can as well\nbe used for various other complex metallic alloys.\n",

When combined\nwith cluster extensions of dynamical mean-field theory, this method allows us\nto address the effects of spatial correlations, such as the generation of the\nsuperexchange and the momentum dependence of the quasiparticle weight. We\nillustrate the method on a two-band Hubbard model, a Hubbard model made of two\ncoupled layers, and a two-dimensional single-band Hubbard model (within a\ntwo-site cellular dynamical mean-field approximation).\n",

        "abstract": "  In most theories of gravity involving torsion, the source for torsion is the\nintrinsic spin of matter. Since the spins of fermions are normally randomly\noriented in macroscopic bodies, the torsion generated is normally negligible.\nHowever, in a recent paper, Mao et al. point out that there is a class of\ntheories in which the angular momentum of macroscopic spinning bodies generates\na significant amount of torsion. They argue that by the principle of action\nequals reaction, one would expect the angular momentum of test bodies to couple\nto a background torsion field, and therefore the precession of the GPB\ngyroscopes should be affected in these theories by the torsion generated by the\nEarth. We show that in fact the principle of action equals reaction does not\napply to these theories. We examine in detail a generalization of the\nHayashi-Shirafuji theory suggested by Mao et al. called\nEinstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji theory. There are a variety of different versions of\nthis theory, depending on the precise form of the coupling to matter chosen for\nthe torsion. We show that for any coupling to matter that is compatible with\nthe spin transport equation postulated by Mao et al., the theory has either\nghosts or an ill-posed initial value formulation. These theoretical problems\ncan be avoided by specializing the parameters of the theory and in addition\nchoosing the standard minimal coupling to matter of the torsion tensor. This\nyields a consistent theory, but one in which the action equals reaction\nprinciple is violated, and in which the angular momentum of the gyroscopes does\nnot couple to the Earth's torsion field. Thus, the Einstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji\ntheory does not predict a detectable torsion signal for Gravity Probe B. There\nmay be other torsion theories which do.\n",

        "abstract": "  We review the recently discovered interplay between chaos and symmetry in the\ngeneral inhomogeneous solution of many string-related Einstein-matter systems\nin the vicinity of a cosmological singularity. The\nBelinsky-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz-type chaotic behaviour is found, for many\nEinstein-matter models (notably those related to the low-energy limit of\nsuperstring theory and M-theory), to be connected with certain\n(infinite-dimensional) hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebras. In particular, the\nbilliard chambers describing the asymptotic cosmological behaviour of pure\nEinstein gravity in spacetime dimension d+1, or the metric-three-form system of\n11-dimensional supergravity, are found to be identical to the Weyl chambers of\nthe Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebras AE_d, or E_{10}, respectively. This suggests\nthat these Kac-Moody algebras are hidden symmetries of the corresponding\nmodels. There even exists some evidence of a hidden equivalence between the\ngeneral solution of the Einstein-three-form system and a null geodesic in the\ninfinite dimensional coset space E_{10} / K(E_{10}), where K(E_{10}) is the\nmaximal compact subgroup of E_{10}.\n",

        "abstract": "  We present a protocol for growing graph states, the resource for one-way\nquantum computing, when the available entanglement mechanism is highly\nimperfect. The distillation protocol is frugal in its use of ancilla qubits,\nrequiring only a single ancilla qubit when the noise is dominated by one Pauli\nerror, and two for a general noise model. The protocol works with such scarce\nlocal resources by never post-selecting on the measurement outcomes of\npurification rounds. We find that such a strategy causes fidelity to follow a\nbiased random walk, and that a target fidelity is likely to be reached more\nrapidly than for a comparable post-selecting protocol. An analysis is presented\nof how imperfect local operations limit the attainable fidelity. For example, a\nsingle Pauli error rate of 20% can be distilled down to $\\sim 10$ times the\nimperfection in local operations.\n",

In a first stage we study the\nsemi-infinite system consisting of an isotropic fluid in contact with a single\nhard line. We have found complete wetting by the columnar phase at the\nwall-isotropic fluid interface. When the fluid is confined between two hard\nwalls, capillary columnar ordering occurs via a first-order phase transition.\nFor higher chemical potentials the system exhibits layering transitions even\nfor very narrow slits (near the one-dimensional limit). The theoretical model\nused was a density-functional theory based on the Fundamental-Measure\nFunctional applied to a fluid of hard rectangles in the restricted-orientation\napproximation (Zwanzig model). The results presented here can be checked\nexperimentally in two-dimensional granular media made of rods, where vertical\nmotions induced by an external source and excluded volume interactions between\nthe grains allow the system to explore those stationary states which\nentropically maximize packing configurations. We claim that some of the surface\nphenomena found here can be present in two-dimensional granular-media fluids.\n",

        "abstract": "  The magnetic structure of the intermetallic antiferromagnet Sm2IrIn8 was\ndetermined using x-ray resonant magnetic scattering (XRMS). Below TN = 14.2,\nSm2IrIn8 has a commensurate antiferromagnetic structure with a propagation\nvector (1/2,0,0). The Sm magnetic moments lie in the ab plane and are rotated\nroughly 18 degrees away from the a axis. The magnetic structure of this\ncompound was obtained by measuring the strong dipolar resonant peak whose\nenhancement was of over two orders of magnitude at the L2 edge. At the L3 edge\nboth quadrupolar and dipolar features were observed in the energy line shape.\nThe magnetic structure and properties of Sm2IrIn8 are found to be consistent\nwith the general trend already seen for the Nd-, Tb- and the Ce-based compounds\nfrom the RmMnIn3m+2n family (R = rare earth; M=Rh or Ir, m = 1, 2; n = 0, 1),\nwhere the crystalline electrical field (CEF) effects determine the direction of\nmagnetic moments and the TN evolution in the series. The measured Neel\ntemperature for Sm2IrIn8 is slightly suppressed when compared to the TN of the\nparent cubic compound SmIn3.\n",

The transmitted signals are\ndeterministic but carries imprinted noise that cannot be eliminated by the\nattacker. Thus, a one-time pad for Internet can be made practical. Security is\nachieved without third parties and not relying on the difficulty of factoring\nnumbers in primes. An informational fragility to be avoided is discussed.\nInformation-theoretic analysis is presented and bounds for secure operation are\ndetermined.\n",

        "abstract": "  Although taste violations significantly affect the results of staggered\ncalculations of pseudoscalar and heavy-light mesonic quantities, those entering\nstaggered calculations of baryonic quantities have not been quantified. Here I\ndevelop staggered chiral perturbation theory in the light-quark baryon sector\nby mapping the Symanzik action into heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory.\nFor 2+1 dynamical quark flavors, the masses of flavor-symmetric nucleons are\ncalculated to third order in partially quenched and fully dynamical staggered\nchiral perturbation theory. To this order the expansion includes the leading\nchiral logarithms, which come from loops with virtual decuplet-like states, as\nwell as terms the order of the cubed pion mass, which come from loops with\nvirtual octet-like states. Taste violations enter through the meson propagators\nin loops and tree-level terms the order of the squared lattice spacing. The\npattern of taste symmetry breaking and the resulting degeneracies and mixings\nare discussed in detail. The resulting chiral forms are appropriate to lattice\nresults obtained with operators already in use and could be used to study the\nrestoration of taste symmetry in the continuum limit. I assume that the fourth\nroot of the fermion determinant can be incorporated in staggered chiral\nperturbation theory using the replica method.\n",

We see the semicircular trajectories of electrons as they bounce along\na boundary in the 2DEG, as well as fringes showing the coherent nature of the\nelectron waves. Imaging flow in open systems is made possible by a cooled\nscanning probe microscope. Remarkable agreement between experiment and theory\ndemonstrates our ability to see these trajectories and to use this system as an\ninterferometer. We image branched electron flow as well as the interference of\nelectron waves. This technique can visualize the motion of electron waves\nbetween two points in an open system, providing a straightforward way to study\nsystems that may be useful for quantum information processing and spintronics.\n",

Since previous analysis indicate that hyperonic stars or\nstars containing a kaon condensate are not good candidates, the only remaining\npossibility is that such an object is either a strange quark star or a hybrid\nquark-hadron star.

Originally the electron was studied in a non\nrelativistic context and this opened up the interesting possibility that lead\nto the conclusion that the mass of the electron could be thought of entirely in\nelectromagnetic terms without introducing inertial considerations. However the\napplication of Special Relativity lead to several problems, both for an\nextended electron and the point electron. These inconsistencies have, contrary\nto popular belief not been resolved satisfactorily today, even within the\ncontext of Quantum Theory. Nevertheless these and subsequent studies bring out\nthe interesting result that Special Relativity breaks down within the Compton\nscale or when the Compton scale is not neglected. This again runs contrary to\nan uncritical notion that Special Relativity is valid for point particles.\n",

The latter\nbehavior is sensitive to material properties such as the collision parameters,\nthe moment of inertia and the collision rate. Interestingly, there are\npreferred ratios of rotational-to-total energy. In general, f(x) is strongly\ncorrelated with energy and the deviations from a uniform distribution grow with\nenergy. We also solve for the energy distribution of freely cooling Maxwell\nMolecules and find qualitatively similar behavior.\n",

Specific heat and resistivity measurements\nreveal that there are characteristic low-energy phonons that give rise to\nunusual scattering of carriers due to strong electron-phonon interactions. The\nentity of the low-energy phonons is ascribed to the heavy rattling of the K ion\nconfined in an oversized cage made of OsO6 octahedra.

It tends to infinity at long\nwavelength, which yields a Bose glass state that is robust to the addition of\nweak point-pinning centers, and which implies a restoring force per vortex line\nfor rigid translations about mechanical equilibrium that is independent of\nmagnetic field. It also indicates that the Bose glass state breaks into pieces\nalong the direction of the correlated pinning centers if the latter have finite\nlength. The critical current is predicted to crossover from two dimensional to\nthree dimensional behavior as a function of sample thickness along the\ncorrelated pinning centers in such case. That crossover notably can occur at a\nfilm thickness that is much larger than that expected from point pins of\ncomparable strength. The above is compared to the dependence on thickness shown\nby the critical current in certain films of high-temperature superconductors\ncurrently being developed for wire technology.\n",

        "abstract": "  Density-functional theory has been applied to investigate systematics of\nsodium clusters Na_n in the size range of n= 39-55. A clear evolutionary trend\nin the growth of their ground-state geometries emerges. The clusters at the\nbeginning of the series (n=39-43) are symmetric and have partial icosahedral\n(two-shell) structure. The growth then goes through a series of disordered\nclusters (n=44-52) where the icosahedral core is lost. However, for n>52 a\nthree shell icosahedral structure emerges. This change in the nature of the\ngeometry is abrupt. In addition, density-functional molecular dynamics has been\nused to calculate the specific heat curves for the representative sizes n= 43,\n45, 48 and 52. These results along with already available thermodynamic\ncalculations for n= 40, 50, and 55 enable us to carry out a detailed comparison\nof the heat capacity curves with their respective geometries for the entire\nseries. Our results clearly bring out strong correlation between the evolution\nof the geometries and the nature of the shape of the heat capacities. The\nresults also firmly establish the size-sensitive nature of the heat capacities\nin sodium clusters.\n",

Thereby we concentrate on easy plane\nsystems, i.e. systems for which the anisotropy favors a magnetization parallel\nto the film plane. We discuss these systems in perpendicular external field,\ni.e. B parallel to the film normal. GFT results are in good agreement with QMC\nfor high enough fields and temperatures. Below a critical field or a critical\ntemperature no collinear stable magnetization exists in GFT. On the other hand\nQMC gives finite magnetization even below those critical values. This indicates\nthat there occurs a transition from non-collinear to collinear configurations\nwith increasing field or temperature. For slightly tilted external fields a\nrotation of magnetization from out-of-plane to in-plane orientation is found\nwith decreasing temperature.\n",

        "abstract": "  A library of C functions yielding exact solutions of potential and flux\ninfluences due to uniform surface distribution of singularities on flat\ntriangular and rectangular elements has been developed. This library, ISLES,\nhas been used to develop the neBEM solver that is both precise and fast in\nsolving a wide range of problems of scientific and technological interest. Here\nwe present the exact expressions proposed for computing the influence of\nuniform singularity distributions on triangular elements and illustrate their\naccuracy. We also present a study concerning the time taken to evaluate these\nlong and complicated expressions \\textit{vis a vis} that spent in carrying out\nsimple quadratures. Finally, we solve a classic benchmark problem in\nelectrostatics, namely, estimation of the capacitance of a unit square plate\nraised to unit volt. For this problem, we present the estimated values of\ncapacitance and compare them successfully with some of the most accurate\nresults available in the literature. In addition, we present the variation of\nthe charge density close to the corner of the plate for various degrees of\ndiscretization. The variations are found to be smooth and converging. This is\nin clear contrast to the criticism commonly leveled against usual BEM solvers.\n",

ASIC total energy calculations are mapped onto an\nHeisenberg pair-wise interaction and the exchange constants J are compared to\nthose obtained with other methods. In general the ASIC scheme drastically\nimproves the bandstructure, which for almost all the cases investigated\nresemble closely available photo-emission data. In contrast the results for the\nexchange parameters are less satisfactory. Although ASIC performs reasonably\nwell for systems where the magnetism originates from half-filled bands, it\nsuffers from similar problems than those of LDA for other situations. In\nparticular the exchange constants are still overestimated. This reflects a\nsubtle interplay between exchange and correlation energy, not captured by the\nASIC.\n",

The entanglement distribution in Gaussian valence\nbond states can be controlled by varying the input amount of entanglement\nengineered in a (2M+1)-mode Gaussian state known as the building block, which\nis isomorphic to the projector applied at a given site. We show how this\nmechanism can be interpreted in terms of multiple entanglement swapping from\nthe chain of ancillary bonds, through the building blocks. We provide optical\nschemes to produce bisymmetric three-mode Gaussian building blocks (which\ncorrespond to a single bond, M=1), and study the entanglement structure in the\noutput Gaussian valence bond states. The usefulness of such states for quantum\ncommunication protocols with continuous variables, like telecloning and\nteleportation networks, is finally discussed.\n",

At low applied magnetic fields, the system first orders\nmagnetically below Tm1 ~ 21 K, and then shows a second magnetic phase\ntransition at Tm2 ~ 15 K. In addition, a phase transition that is apparent in\nspecific heat but not seen in magnetization is found for all three applied\nfield orientations, converging towards Tm2 as H -> 0. The magnetic behavior is\nhighly anisotropic, with critical fields for magnetic phase boundaries much\nhigher when the field is applied perpendicular to the Kagome staircase plane\nthan when applied in-plane. The field-temperature (H - T) phase diagrams are\nquite rich, with 7 distinct phases observed.\n",

Results are presented at the level of a\nBCS treatment, a number-projected BCS treatment and an exact treatment using\nthe Richardson ansatz. While projected BCS captures much of the pairing\ncorrelation energy that is absent from BCS, it still misses a sizable\ncorrelation energy, typically of order $1 MeV$. Furthermore, because it does\nnot average over the properties of the fermion pairs, the exact Richardson\nsolution permits a more meaningful definition of the Cooper wave function and\nof the fraction of pairs that are collective.\n",

The channels\nincluded in the calculations are $\\pi N$, $\\eta N$ and $\\pi\\pi N$ which has\n$\\pi\\Delta$, $\\rho N$, and $\\sigma N$ resonant components. The non-resonant\nmeson-baryon interactions of the model are derived from a set of Lagrangians by\nusing a unitary transformation method. One or two bare excited nucleon states\nin each of $S$, $P$, $D$, and $F$ partial waves are included to generate the\nresonant amplitudes in the fits. The parameters of the model are first\ndetermined by fitting as much as possible the empirical $\\pi N$ elastic\nscattering amplitudes of SAID up to 2 GeV. We then refine and confirm the\nresulting parameters by directly comparing the predicted differential cross\nsection and target polarization asymmetry with the original data of the elastic\n$\\pi^{\\pm} p \\to \\pi^{\\pm} p$ and charge-exchange $\\pi^- p \\to \\pi^0 n$\nprocesses. The predicted total cross sections of $\\pi N$ reactions and $\\pi\nN\\to \\eta N$ reactions are also in good agreement with the data. Applications\nof the constructed model in analyzing the electromagnetic meson production data\nas well as the future developments are discussed.\n",

        "abstract": "  In the last twenty years there has been significant progress in our\nunderstanding of quantum transport far from equilibrium and a conceptual\nframework has emerged through a combination of the Landauer approach with the\nnon-equilibrium Green function (NEGF) method, which is now being widely used in\nthe analysis and design of nanoscale devices. It provides a unified description\nfor all kinds of devices from molecular conductors to carbon nanotubes to\nsilicon transistors covering different transport regimes from the ballistic to\nthe diffusive limit. In this talk I use a simple version of this model to\nanalyze a specially designed device that could be called an electronic\nMaxwell's demon, one that lets electrons go preferentially in one direction\nover another. My objective is to illustrate the fundamental role of contacts\nand demons in transport and energy conversion. The discussion is kept at an\nacademic level steering clear of real world details, but the illustrative\ndevices we use are very much within the capabilities of present-day technology.\nFor example, recent experiments on thermoelectric effects in molecular\nconductors agree well with the predictions from our model. The Maxwell's demon\ndevice itself is very similar to the pentalayer spin-torque device which has\nbeen studied by a number of groups though we are not aware of any discussion of\nthe possibility of using the device as a nanoscale heat engine or as a\nrefrigerator as proposed here. However, my objective is not to evaluate\npossible practical applications. Rather it is to introduce a simple transparent\nmodel showing how out-of-equibrium demons suitably incorporated into\nnanodevices can achieve energy conversion.\n",

Nearest-neighbor repulsion between the Bosons leads to the development\nof short-range density order at the antiferromagnetic wavevector, and\nsimultaneously a roton minima in the density excitation spectra. On the\nsquare-lattice, the model maps on to the well studied XXZ model, and the roton\ngap collapses to zero precisely at the Heisenberg symmetry point, leading to\nthe well known spectra for the Heisenberg antiferromagnet. On the\ntriangular-lattice, the collapse of the roton gap signals the onset of the\nsupersolid phase. Our results suggest that the transition from the superfluid\nto the supersolid phase maybe weakly first order.

We show that this critical nearest neighbor Coulomb interaction\nis different for each spin subspace, with the critical value decreasing with\nincreasing spin. As a consequence, with the lowering of temperature, there can\noccur a transition from a Wigner crystal charge-ordered state to a spin-Peierls\nstate that is a Bond-Charge-Density Wave with charge occupancies different from\nthe Wigner crystal. This transition is possible because spin excitations from\nthe spin-Peierls state in the 1/4-filled band are necessarily accompanied by\nchanges in site charge densities. We apply our theory to the 1/4-filled band\nquasi-one-dimensional organic charge-transfer solids in general and to 2:1\ntetramethyltetrathiafulvalene (TMTTF) and tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene\n(TMTSF) cationic salts in particular. We believe that many recent experiments\nstrongly indicate the Wigner crystal to Bond-Charge-Density Wave transition in\nseveral members of the TMTTF family. We explain the occurrence of two different\nantiferromagnetic phases but a single spin-Peierls state in the generic phase\ndiagram for the 2:1 cationic solids. The antiferromagnetic phases can have\neither the Wigner crystal or the Bond-Charge-Spin-Density Wave charge\noccupancies. The spin-Peierls state is always a Bond-Charge-Density Wave.\n",

It is pointed out that a gravitationally collapsing black hole acts as\nan ultrahigh energy particle accelerator that can accelerate particles to\nenergies inconceivable in any terrestrial particle accelerator, and that when\nthe energy $E$ of the particles comprising matter in a black hole is $\\sim\n10^{2} GeV$ or more, or equivalently, the temperature $T$ is $\\sim 10^{15} K$\nor more, the entire matter in the black hole is converted into quark-gluon\nplasma permeated by leptons. As quarks and leptons are fermions, it is\nemphasized that the collapse of a black-hole to a space-time singularity is\ninhibited by Pauli's exclusion principle. It is also suggested that ultimately\na black hole may end up either as a stable quark star, or as a pulsating quark\nstar which may be a source of gravitational radiation, or it may simply explode\nwith a mini bang of a sort.\n",

We introduce a kinetically constrained lattice gas model that preserves\nthe connectivity of the chain, and we use this kinetically constrained model to\nstudy the dynamics of the polymer at varying densities through Monte Carlo\nsimulations. Even at densities close to the fully-packed configuration, we find\nthat the monomers comprising the chain manage to diffuse around the box with a\nroot mean square displacement of the order of the box dimensions over time\nscales for which the overall geometry of the polymer is, nevertheless, largely\npreserved. To capture this shape persistence, we define the local tangent field\nand study the two-time tangent-tangent correlation function, which exhibits a\nglass-like behavior. In both closed and open chains, we observe reptational\nmotion and reshaping through local fingering events which entail global monomer\ndisplacement.\n",

        "abstract": "  Fluctuations in the abundance of molecules in the living cell may affect its\ngrowth and well being. For regulatory molecules (e.g., signaling proteins or\ntranscription factors), fluctuations in their expression can affect the levels\nof downstream targets in a network. Here, we develop an analytic framework to\ninvestigate the phenomenon of noise correlation in molecular networks.\nSpecifically, we focus on the metabolic network, which is highly inter-linked,\nand noise properties may constrain its structure and function. Motivated by the\nanalogy between the dynamics of a linear metabolic pathway and that of the\nexactly soluable linear queueing network or, alternatively, a mass transfer\nsystem, we derive a plethora of results concerning fluctuations in the\nabundance of intermediate metabolites in various common motifs of the metabolic\nnetwork. For all but one case examined, we find the steady-state fluctuation in\ndifferent nodes of the pathways to be effectively uncorrelated. Consequently,\nfluctuations in enzyme levels only affect local properties and do not propagate\nelsewhere into metabolic networks, and intermediate metabolites can be freely\nshared by different reactions. Our approach may be applicable to study\nmetabolic networks with more complex topologies, or protein signaling networks\nwhich are governed by similar biochemical reactions. Possible implications for\nbioinformatic analysis of metabolimic data are discussed.\n",

In this paper, we propose a simple\nweighted network model with accelerating growth. We derive analytical\nexpressions for the evolutions and distributions for strength, degree, and\nweight, which are relevant to accelerating growth. We also find that\naccelerating growth determines the clustering coefficient of the networks.\nInterestingly, the distributions for strength, degree, and weight display a\ntransition from scale-free to exponential form when the parameter with respect\nto accelerating growth increases from a small to large value. All the\ntheoretical predictions are successfully contrasted with extensive numerical\nsimulations.\n",

We demonstrate\nexplicitly that the $N_p N_n$ scheme for the excitation energy emerges from the\nseparate exponential dependence of the excitation energy on the valence nucleon\nnumbers $N_p$ and $N_n$ together with the fact that only a limited set of\nnumbers is allowed for the $N_p$ and $N_n$ of the existing nuclei.\n",

Energy levels of the quantum well are\nassumed discrete, and two closely located excited levels are taken into\naccount. A wide quantum well (the width of which is comparable to the length of\nthe light wave, corresponding to the pulse carrying frequency) is considered,\nand the dependance of the interband matrix element of the momentum operator on\nthe light wave vector is taken into account. Refractive indices of barriers and\nquantum well are assumed equal each other. The problem is solved for an\narbitrary ratio of radiative and nonradiative lifetimes of electronic\nexcitations. It is shown that the spatial dispersion essentially affects the\nshapes of reflected and transmitted pulses. The largest changes occur when the\nradiative broadening is close to the difference of frequencies of interband\ntransitions taken into account.\n",

The spectral function shows a single resonance peak which\nbecomes wider and then disappears as the temperature is increased beyond 450\nMeV or so. This behaviour can be compared with recently attempted lattice\nreconstructions of the same quantity, based on the ``maximum entropy method'',\nwhich generically show several peaks. We also specify the dependence of our\nresults on the spatial momentum of the electromagnetic current, as well as on\nthe baryon chemical potential characterising the hot QCD plasma.\n",

        "abstract": "  As networks and their structure have become a major field of research, a\nstrong demand for network visualization has emerged. We address this challenge\nby formalizing the well established spring layout in terms of dynamic\nequations. We thus open up the design space for new algorithms. Drawing from\nthe knowledge of systems design, we derive a layout algorithm that remedies\nseveral drawbacks of the original spring layout. This new algorithm relies on\nthe balancing of two antagonistic forces. We thus call it {\\em arf} for\n\"attractive and repulsive forces\". It is, as we claim, particularly suited for\na dynamic layout of smaller networks ($n < 10^3$). We back this claim with\nseveral application examples from on going complex systems research.\n",

Furthermore we quantify the simultaneity error\noccurring in the relativity theory. Having done this, we analyse the root cause\nof these effects and identify it with a finite phase velocity associated with\nthe moving frame. We define this phase velocity by analogy to the de Broglie\nwave associated with a moving particle. Based on this construct we demonstrate\nthat the phase of the de Broglie waves further extended for stationary\nparticles is a relativistic invariant being the same for all corresponding\nobservers. Also the phase of the electromagnetic waves transporting energy at\nlight speed is a relativistic invariant. Therefore the universe and its matter\n/ energy may be seen as a superposition of waves propagating such that their\nphase is the same for all corresponding observers. The wave phase may replace\nthe time as an invariant and universal reference.\n",

        "abstract": "  The analysis of gravitational wave data involves many model selection\nproblems. The most important example is the detection problem of selecting\nbetween the data being consistent with instrument noise alone, or instrument\nnoise and a gravitational wave signal. The analysis of data from ground based\ngravitational wave detectors is mostly conducted using classical statistics,\nand methods such as the Neyman-Pearson criteria are used for model selection.\nFuture space based detectors, such as the \\emph{Laser Interferometer Space\nAntenna} (LISA), are expected to produced rich data streams containing the\nsignals from many millions of sources. Determining the number of sources that\nare resolvable, and the most appropriate description of each source poses a\nchallenging model selection problem that may best be addressed in a Bayesian\nframework. An important class of LISA sources are the millions of low-mass\nbinary systems within our own galaxy, tens of thousands of which will be\ndetectable. Not only are the number of sources unknown, but so are the number\nof parameters required to model the waveforms. For example, a significant\nsubset of the resolvable galactic binaries will exhibit orbital frequency\nevolution, while a smaller number will have measurable eccentricity. In the\nBayesian approach to model selection one needs to compute the Bayes factor\nbetween competing models. Here we explore various methods for computing Bayes\nfactors in the context of determining which galactic binaries have measurable\nfrequency evolution. The methods explored include a Reverse Jump Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm, Savage-Dickie density ratios, the Schwarz-Bayes\nInformation Criterion (BIC), and the Laplace approximation to the model\nevidence. We find good agreement between all of the approaches.\n",

We find that contrary to some previous expectations, triplet\ncorrelations, odd in time, are induced in both the S and F layers in the clean\nlimit. We investigate their behavior as a function of time, position, and\n$\\alpha$. The triplet amplitudes are largest at times on the order of the\ninverse ``Debye'' frequency, and at that time scale they are long ranged in\nboth S and F.

The creep compliance is\ndetermined simultaneously with the structural relaxation under a constant\nuniaxial load below yield at constant temperature. The model successfully\ncaptures universal features found experimentally in polymer glasses, including\nsignatures of mechanical rejuvenation. We analyze microscopic relaxation\ntimescales and show that they exhibit the same aging characteristics as the\nmacroscopic creep compliance. In addition, our model indicates that the entire\ndistribution of relaxation times scales identically with age. Despite large\nchanges in mobility, we observe comparatively little structural change except\nfor a weak logarithmic increase in the degree of short-range order that may be\ncorrelated to an observed decrease in aging with increasing load.\n",

        "abstract": "  Phantom fields with negative kinetic energy are often plagued by the vacuum\nquantum instability in the ultraviolet region. We present a Lorentz-violating\ndark energy model free from this problem and show that the crossing of the\ncosmological constant boundary w=-1 to the phantom equation of state is\nrealized before reaching a de Sitter attractor. Another interesting feature is\na peculiar time-dependence of the effective Newton's constant; the magnitude of\nthis effect is naturally small but may be close to experimental limits. We also\nderive momentum scales of instabilities at which tachyons or ghosts appear in\nthe infrared region around the present Hubble scale and clarify the conditions\nunder which tachyonic instabilities do not spoil homogeneity of the\npresent/future Universe.\n",

Plastic\nflow was calculated self-consistently with the shock jump conditions: this is\nnecessary for a rigorous estimate of the locus of shock states accessible. The\ntemperatures obtained were significantly higher than predicted assuming ideal\nhydrodynamic loading. The temperatures were compared with surface emission\nspectrometry measurements for Mo shocked to around 60GPa and then released into\nvacuum or into a LiF window. Shock loading was induced by the impact of a\nplanar projectile, accelerated by high explosive or in a gas gun. Surface\nvelocimetry showed an elastic wave at the start of release from the shocked\nstate; the amplitude of the elastic wave matched the prediction to around 10%,\nindicating that the predicted flow stress in the shocked state was reasonable.\nThe measured temperatures were consistent with the simulations, indicating that\nthe fraction of plastic work converted to heat was in the range 70-100% for\nthese loading conditions.\n",

In 2d geometry, excluded volume interactions between monomers of a chain\nconfined inside a strip of finite length 2L transform the coil conformation\ninto a linear string of blobs. However, the blob picture raises questions on\nthe nature of this escape transition. To check the theoretical predictions\nbased on the blob picture we study 2d single polymer chains with excluded\nvolume interactions and with one end grafted in the middle of a strip of length\n  2L and width H by simulating self-avoiding walks on a square lattice with the\npruned-enriched-Rosenbluth method (PERM). We estimate the free energy, the\nend-to-end distance, the number of imprisoned monomers, the order parameter,\nand its distribution. It is shown that in the thermodynamic limit of large N\nand L but finite L/N, there is a small but finite jump in several average\ncharacteristics, including the order parameter. We also present a theoretical\ndescription based on the Landau free energy approach, which is in good\nagreement with the simulation results. Both simulation results and the\nanalytical theory indicate that the 2d escape transition is a weak first-order\nphase transition.\n",

The sample is an indium film with a large elastic mean free\npath (11 mkm) deposited on a silicon oxide wafer. It is shown that PNR can\nresolve the difference between the reflected neutron spin asymmetries predicted\nby the local and nonlocal theories of superconductivity. The experimental data\nsupport the nonlocal theory, which predicts a nonmonotonic decay of the\nmagnetic field.\n",

These predictions are checked against the real-time evolution of\nsome solvable models that allows also to understand which features are valid\nbeyond the critical evolution.\n  All our findings may be explained in terms of a picture generally valid,\nwhereby quasiparticles, entangled over regions of the order of the correlation\nlength in the initial state, then propagate with a finite speed through the\nsystem. Furthermore we show that the long-time results can be interpreted in\nterms of a generalized Gibbs ensemble. We discuss some open questions and\npossible future developments.\n",

Here we explore the effects of choice on\nmodels of tree and network growth. In our models each new node has k randomly\nchosen contacts, where k > 1 is a constant. It then attaches to whichever one\nof these contacts is most desirable in some sense, such as its distance from\nthe root or its degree. Even when the new node has just two choices, i.e., when\nk=2, the resulting network can be very different from a random graph or tree.\nFor instance, if the new node attaches to the contact which is closest to the\nroot of the tree, the distribution of depths changes from Poisson to a\ntraveling wave solution. If the new node attaches to the contact with the\nsmallest degree, the degree distribution is closer to uniform than in a random\ngraph, so that with high probability there are no nodes in the network with\ndegree greater than O(log log N). Finally, if the new node attaches to the\ncontact with the largest degree, we find that the degree distribution is a\npower law with exponent -1 up to degrees roughly equal to k, with an\nexponential cutoff beyond that; thus, in this case, we need k >> 1 to see a\npower law over a wide range of degrees.\n",

From this, we calculate the real\nand imaginary parts of the diagonal elements of the magnetoconductivity tensor,\nwhich in turn allows us to extract the concentration, effective mass, and\nscattering time of the electrons in the sample. We demonstrate the utility of\nultrafast terahertz spectroscopy, which can recover the true linewidth of\ncyclotron resonance in a high-mobility ($>{10}^{6} \\mathrm{cm^{2} V^{-1}\ns^{-1}}$) sample without being affected by the saturation effect.\n",

        "abstract": "  A model for charge transfer mechanism in YBa2Cu3O6+x high-Tc cuprate based on\ncritical chain length concept is proposed to account for 60K and 90K plateaus\nin Tc(x) dependence. It has been shown, when the statistics of CuO chain\nformation was described in terms of two dimensional asymmetric next-to-nearest\nneighbor Ising (ASYNNNI) model, that at any constant temperature below the top\nof OII phase there exists a uniquely defined value of critical chain length\nlcr(T) that yields a constant doping p(x)=const over the regime of OII phase\n(related to 60K plateau of Tc(x)), while 90K plateau coincides with the\nmonotonously increasing p(x) over optimal doping level p=0.16 in the regime of\nOI phase. Short length chains (l<lcr(T)), together with the first lcr(T)-2\nholes in longer chains (l>lcr(T)), are taken as not capable of attracting\nelectrons from CuO2 planes.. It is shown that only a part (41%) of the\nremaining l-lcr(T)+1 holes in the long chains can capture electrons. The\nresults obtained indicate that the ASYNNNI model and two-plateaus-like behavior\nof Tc(x) in YBa2Cu3O6+x are closely connected.\n",

        "abstract": "  We compute solutions of the Lagrangian-Averaged Navier-Stokes alpha-model\n(LANS) for significantly higher Reynolds numbers (up to Re 8300) than have\npreviously been accomplished. This allows sufficient separation of scales to\nobserve a Navier-Stokes (NS) inertial range followed by a 2nd LANS inertial\nrange. The analysis of the third-order structure function scaling supports the\npredicted l^3 scaling; it corresponds to a k^(-1) scaling of the energy\nspectrum. The energy spectrum itself shows a different scaling which goes as\nk^1. This latter spectrum is consistent with the absence of stretching in the\nsub-filter scales due to the Taylor frozen-in hypothesis employed as a closure\nin the derivation of LANS. These two scalings are conjectured to coexist in\ndifferent spatial portions of the flow. The l^3 (E(k) k^(-1)) scaling is\nsubdominant to k^1 in the energy spectrum, but the l^3 scaling is responsible\nfor the direct energy cascade, as no cascade can result from motions with no\ninternal degrees of freedom. We verify the prediction for the size of the LANS\nattractor resulting from this scaling. From this, we give a methodology either\nfor arriving at grid-independent solutions for LANS, or for obtaining a\nformulation of a LES optimal in the context of the alpha models. The fully\nconverged grid-independent LANS may not be the best approximation to a direct\nnumerical simulation of the NS equations since the minimum error is a balance\nbetween truncation errors and the approximation error due to using LANS instead\nof the primitive equations. Furthermore, the small-scale behavior of LANS\ncontributes to a reduction of flux at constant energy, leading to a shallower\nenergy spectrum for large alpha. These small-scale features, do not preclude\nLANS to reproduce correctly the intermittency properties of high Re flow.\n",

Larger deviations result in a lack of CE\norder at any temperature. Thus, small inhomogeneities in cation or oxygen\ncomposition could explain why others commonly see this reentrance with\ncoexistence.\n",

The\ncalculations are made at the squared lattice spacings at an equal distance\na^2~0.005, 0.01 and 0.015 fm^2, and the continuum limit is taken assuming an\nO(a^2) discretization error. The light meson spectrum is consistent with\nexperiment. The up, down and strange quark masses in the \\bar{MS} scheme at 2\nGeV are \\bar{m}=(m_{u}+m_{d})/2=3.55^{+0.65}_{-0.28} MeV and\nm_s=90.1^{+17.2}_{-6.1} MeV where the error includes statistical and all\nsystematic errors added in quadrature. These values contain the previous\nestimates obtained with the dynamical u and d quarks within the error.\n",

        "abstract": "  Dielectric micro-cavities are widely used as laser resonators and\ncharacterizations of their spectra are of interest for various applications. We\nexperimentally investigate micro-lasers of simple shapes (Fabry-Perot, square,\npentagon, and disk). Their lasing spectra consist mainly of almost equidistant\npeaks and the distance between peaks reveals the length of a quantized periodic\norbit. To measure this length with a good precision, it is necessary to take\ninto account different sources of refractive index dispersion. Our experimental\nand numerical results agree with the superscar model describing the formation\nof long-lived states in polygonal cavities. The limitations of the\ntwo-dimensional approximation are briefly discussed in connection with\nmicro-disks.\n",

        "abstract": "  We study cascading failures in networks using a dynamical flow model based on\nsimple conservation and distribution laws to investigate the impact of\ntransient dynamics caused by the rebalancing of loads after an initial network\nfailure (triggering event). It is found that considering the flow dynamics may\nimply reduced network robustness compared to previous static overload failure\nmodels. This is due to the transient oscillations or overshooting in the loads,\nwhen the flow dynamics adjusts to the new (remaining) network structure. We\nobtain {\\em upper} and {\\em lower} limits to network robustness, and it is\nshown that {\\it two} time scales $\\tau$ and $\\tau_0$, defined by the network\ndynamics, are important to consider prior to accurately addressing network\nrobustness or vulnerability. The robustness of networks showing cascading\nfailures is generally determined by a complex interplay between the network\ntopology and flow dynamics, where the ratio $\\chi=\\tau/\\tau_0$ determines the\nrelative role of the two of them.\n",

        "abstract": "  We present a study of thermoelectric coefficients in CeCoIn_5 down to 0.1 K\nand up to 16 T in order to probe the thermoelectric signatures of quantum\ncriticality. In the vicinity of the field-induced quantum critical point, the\nNernst coefficient nu exhibits a dramatic enhancement without saturation down\nto lowest measured temperature. The dimensionless ratio of Seebeck coefficient\nto electronic specific heat shows a minimum at a temperature close to threshold\nof the quasiparticle formation. Close to T_c(H), in the vortex-liquid state,\nthe Nernst coefficient behaves anomalously in puzzling contrast with other\nsuperconductors and standard vortex dynamics.\n",

We use variational\nprojection-operator method and numerical renormalization group (NRG) method.\nThe spin is Kondo screened either by even or odd conduction channel depending\non the gate voltage and electron-phonon coupling.

By solving\nthe three-body equation the energy dependence of the resonant \\bar{K}N\namplitude is fully taken into account. The S-matrix pole has been investigated\nfrom the eigenvalue of the kernel with the analytic continuation of the\nscattering amplitude on the unphysical Riemann sheet. The \\barKN interaction is\nconstructed from the leading order term of the chiral Lagrangian using\nrelativistic kinematics. The \\Lambda(1405) resonance is dynamically generated\nin this model, where the \\bar{K}N interaction parameters are fitted to the data\nof scattering length. As a result we find a three-body resonance of the strange\ndibaryon system with binding energy, B~79 MeV, and width, \\Gamma~74 MeV. The\nenergy of the three-body resonance is found to be sensitive to the model of the\nI=0 \\barKN interaction.\n",

We calculate the universal 2+1-dimensional plane equations of\ngravitational field in general relativity. Based on the equations, the\nevolutions of disk nebula are discussed. A system of nebula can form binary\nstars or single star for different conditions. While any simplified linear\ntheory forms only a single star system. It is proved that the nonlinear\ninteractions are very general, so the binary stars are also common.\n",

We demonstrate that the domain\nformation is a co-effect of the quantum coherence and the thermal relaxation.

        "abstract": "  The dynamics of many socioeconomic systems is determined by the decision\nmaking process of agents. The decision process depends on agent's\ncharacteristics, such as preferences, risk aversion, behavioral biases, etc..\nIn addition, in some systems the size of agents can be highly heterogeneous\nleading to very different impacts of agents on the system dynamics. The large\nsize of some agents poses challenging problems to agents who want to control\ntheir impact, either by forcing the system in a given direction or by hiding\ntheir intentionality. Here we consider the financial market as a model system,\nand we study empirically how agents strategically adjust the properties of\nlarge orders in order to meet their preference and minimize their impact. We\nquantify this strategic behavior by detecting scaling relations of allometric\nnature between the variables characterizing the trading activity of different\ninstitutions. We observe power law distributions in the investment time\nhorizon, in the number of transactions needed to execute a large order and in\nthe traded value exchanged by large institutions and we show that heterogeneity\nof agents is a key ingredient for the emergence of some aggregate properties\ncharacterizing this complex system.\n",

        "abstract": "  In this talk we discuss at hand of two examples the crucial role played by\nself consistency in hadron physics. The first example concerns the quark-mass\ndependence of the baryon octet and decuplet masses. It is shown that within a\nself consistent one-loop approach based on the chiral Lagrangian the\n'mysterious' quark-mass dependence of the $\\Xi$ mass predicted by the MILC\ncollaboration may be recovered in terms of a discontinuous chiral\nextrapolation. This is a consequence of self consistency imposed on the partial\nsummation, i.e. the masses used in the loop functions are identical to those\nobtained from the baryon self energies. In the second example we discuss recent\nstudies on the properties of D mesons in cold nuclear matter as they are\npredicted by coupled-channel dynamics. Here a self consistent many-body\napproach reveals the close interlink of the properties of D meson and\nopen-charm baryon resonances in nuclear matter. The relevance of exotic baryon\nresonances for the spectral distortion of the $D_s^\\pm$ in nuclear matter is\npointed out.\n",

Input values of gluon condensates at finite\ntemperature are extracted from lattice QCD data for the energy density and\npressure. Although stability of the moment ratio is achieved only up to T/Tc ~\n1.05, the gluon condensates cause a decrease of the moment ratio, which results\nin change of spectral properties. Using the Breit-Wigner form for the\nphenomenological side, we find that mass shift of J/psi just above Tc can reach\nmaximally 200 MeV and width can broaden to dozens of MeV.\n",

        "abstract": "  The rate of nuclear muon capture by the proton has been measured using a new\nexperimental technique based on a time projection chamber operating in\nultra-clean, deuterium-depleted hydrogen gas at 1 MPa pressure. The capture\nrate was obtained from the difference between the measured $\\mu^-$\ndisappearance rate in hydrogen and the world average for the $\\mu^+$ decay\nrate. The target's low gas density of 1% compared to liquid hydrogen is key to\navoiding uncertainties that arise from the formation of muonic molecules. The\ncapture rate from the hyperfine singlet ground state of the $\\mu p$ atom is\nmeasured to be $\\Lambda_S=725.0 \\pm 17.4 s^{-1}$, from which the induced\npseudoscalar coupling of the nucleon, $g_P(q^2=-0.88 m_\\mu^2)=7.3 \\pm 1.1$, is\nextracted. This result is consistent with theoretical predictions for $g_P$\nthat are based on the approximate chiral symmetry of QCD.\n",

The Hamiltonian H^n derived within this group-theoretical\nmodel has superconducting eigenstates if and only if the considered material\npossesses a narrow, roughly half-filled \"superconducting\" energy band of\nspecial symmetry in its band structure. This paper shows that the\nhigh-temperature superconductor YBa_2Cu_3O_7 possesses such a superconducting\nband. This new result together with previous observations about other\nsuperconductors and non-superconductors corroborates the theoretical evidence\nwithin the NHM that stable superconducting states are connected with\nsuperconducting bands. It is proposed that the type of superconductivity, i.e.,\nwhether the material is a conventional low-T_c or a high-T_c superconductor, is\ndetermined by the energetically lowest boson excitations that carry the crystal\nspin 1*hbar and are sufficiently stable to transport this crystal spin-angular\nmomentum through the crystal. This mechanism provides the electron-phonon\nmechanism that enters the BCS theory in conventional superconductors.\n",

        "abstract": "  The frequency distribution of DNA bases A, C, G, T exhibit fractal\nfluctuations ubiquitous to dynamical systems in nature. The power spectra of\nfractal fluctuations exhibit inverse power law form signifying long-range\ncorrelations between local (small-scale) and global (large-scale)\nperturbations. The author has developed a general systems theory based on\nclassical statistical physics for fractal fluctuations which predicts that the\nprobability distribution of eddy amplitudes and the variance (square of eddy\namplitude)spectrum of fractal fluctuations follow the universal Boltzmann\ninverse power law expressed as a function of the golden mean. The model\npredicted distribution is very close to statistical normal distribution for\nfluctuations within two standard deviations from the mean and exhibits a fat\nlong tail. In this paper it is shown that DNA base CG frequency distribution in\nTakifugu rubripes (Puffer fish) Genome Release 4 exhibit universal inverse\npower law form consistent with model prediction. The observed long-range\ncorrelations in the DNA bases implies that the non-coding 'junk' or 'selfish'\nDNA which appear to be redundant, may also contribute to the efficient\nfunctioning of the protein coding DNA, a result supported by recent studies.\n",

        "abstract": "  The cross-correlations between price fluctuations of 201 frequently traded\nstocks in the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India are analyzed in this\npaper. We use daily closing prices for the period 1996-2006, which coincides\nwith the period of rapid transformation of the market following liberalization.\nThe eigenvalue distribution of the cross-correlation matrix, $\\mathbf{C}$, of\nNSE is found to be similar to that of developed markets, such as the New York\nStock Exchange (NYSE): the majority of eigenvalues fall within the bounds\nexpected for a random matrix constructed from mutually uncorrelated time\nseries. Of the few largest eigenvalues that deviate from the bulk, the largest\nis identified with market-wide movements. The intermediate eigenvalues that\noccur between the largest and the bulk have been associated in NYSE with\nspecific business sectors with strong intra-group interactions. However, in the\nIndian market, these deviating eigenvalues are comparatively very few and lie\nmuch closer to the bulk. We propose that this is because of the relative lack\nof distinct sector identity in the market, with the movement of stocks\ndominantly influenced by the overall market trend. This is shown by explicit\nconstruction of the interaction network in the market, first by generating the\nminimum spanning tree from the unfiltered correlation matrix, and later, using\nan improved method of generating the graph after filtering out the market mode\nand random effects from the data. Both methods show, compared to developed\nmarkets, the relative absence of clusters of co-moving stocks that belong to\nthe same business sector. This is consistent with the general belief that\nemerging markets tend to be more correlated than developed markets.\n",

A 27, 143 (2006)) has been applied in studying\ncenter-of-mass motion effects on the nucleon density and momentum distributions\nin nuclei. We are focused upon effects due to the center-of-mass and\nshort-range nucleon correlations embedded in translationally invariant\nground-state wavefunctions. The latter are constructed in the so-called fixed\ncenter-of-mass approximation, starting with a Slater determinant wave function\nmodified by some correlator (e.g., after Jastrow or Villars). It is shown how\none can simplify evaluation of the corresponding expectation values that\ndetermine the distributions. The analytic expressions derived here involve the\nown \"Tassie-Barker\" factors for each distribution. As an illustration,\nnumerical calculations have been carried out for the nucleus ^{4}He with the\nSlater determinant to describe the nucleon (1s)^4 configuration composed of\nsingle-particle orbitals which differ from harmonic oscillator ones at small\ndistances. Such orbitals simulate somewhat short-range repulsion between\nnucleons. Special attention is paid to a simultaneous shrinking of the\ncenter--of--mass corrected density and momentum distributions compared to the\npurely (1s)^4 shell nontranslationally invariant ones.\n",

        "abstract": "  An acousto-optic cell was used to reduce the speckle noise that reduces the\nquality of Hartmann-Shack and other wave-front sensors measuring ocular\naberrations. In the method presented here, a laser beam traverses an\nacousto-optic cell, interacting with standing acoustic waves. Speckle reduction\ntakes place as the incoming beam is diffractively spread across the cornea. The\nincreased size and the wider angular spread of the incoming beam average out\nthe speckles, producing a more uniform response of the wave-front sensor.\n",

Their stability and\nstructural dynamics is well described by a continuum model, the nanoscale\nfree-electron model, which predicts cylinders in certain intervals of radius to\nbe linearly unstable. In this paper, I study how a small, localized\nperturbation of such an unstable wire grows exponentially and propagates along\nthe wire with a well-defined front. The front is found to be pulled, and forms\na coherent pattern behind it. It is well described by a linear marginal\nstability analysis of front propagation into an unstable state. In some cases,\nnonlinearities of the wire dynamics are found to trigger an invasive mode that\npushes the front. Experimental procedures that could lead to the observation of\nthis phenomenon are suggested.\n",

        "abstract": "  The scaling behaviors of graphene nanoribbon (GNR) Schottky barrier\nfield-effect transistors (SBFETs) are studied by solving the non-equilibrium\nGreen's function (NEGF) transport equation in an atomistic basis set\nself-consistently with a three-dimensional Poisson equation. The armchair edge\nGNR channel shares similarities with a zigzag CNT, but it has a different\ngeometry and quantum confinement boundary condition in the transverse\ndirection. The results indicate that the I-V characteristics are ambipolar and\nstrongly depend on the GNR width because the bandgap of the GNR is\napproximately inversely proportional to its width, which agrees with recent\nexperiments. A multiple gate geometry improves immunity to short channel\neffects, but it offers smaller improvement than it does for Si MOSFETs in terms\nof the on-current and transconductance. Reducing the oxide thickness is more\nuseful for improving transistor performance than using a high-k gate insulator.\nSignificant increase of the minimal leakage current is observed when the\nchannel length is scaled below 10nm because the small effective mass\nfacilitates strong source-drain tunneling. The GNRFET, therefore, does not\npromise extending the ultimate scaling limit of Si MOSFETs. The intrinsic\nswitching speed of a GNR SBFET, however, is several times faster than that of\nSi MOSFETs, which could lead to promising high speed electronics applications,\nwhere the large leakage of GNR SBFETs is of less concern.\n",

The result reveals two important insights to the novel\nsecond harmonic generation (SHG) of alpha-phase lithium iodate\n($\\alpha-LiIO_{3}$) crystal: the existence of finite intra-band momentum matrix\nelements due to the non-inversion symmetry of the crystal illuminating the\npotential of the intra-band transition, and the strong covalent bonding between\nthe $I$-atoms and the ligand $O$-atoms resulting the condition of the\ndouble-resonance. An inter-band transition scenario in SHG as $\\alpha-LiIO_{3}$\nin nano-structure is proposed. The optical properties were calculated within\nthe theoretical framework of the time-dependent perturbation of the\nindependent-particle model. The dielectric tensors and the refractive index\nwere evaluated. Comparisons between the predictions and the results were made:\nthe x-ray near edge absorption spectra; the refractive index at the static\nlimit, and at finite frequencies. Possible factors attributing the calculation\nerrors is discussed.\n",

        "abstract": "  We consider a model of socially interacting individuals that make a binary\nchoice in a context of positive additive endogenous externalities. It\nencompasses as particular cases several models from the sociology and economics\nliterature. We extend previous results to the case of a general distribution of\nidiosyncratic preferences, called here Idiosyncratic Willingnesses to Pay\n(IWP). Positive additive externalities yield a family of inverse demand curves\nthat include the classical downward sloping ones but also new ones with non\nconstant convexity. When j, the ratio of the social influence strength to the\nstandard deviation of the IWP distribution, is small enough, the inverse demand\nis a classical monotonic (decreasing) function of the adoption rate. Even if\nthe IWP distribution is mono-modal, there is a critical value of j above which\nthe inverse demand is non monotonic, decreasing for small and high adoption\nrates, but increasing within some intermediate range. Depending on the price\nthere are thus either one or two equilibria. Beyond this first result, we\nexhibit the generic properties of the boundaries limiting the regions where the\nsystem presents different types of equilibria (unique or multiple). These\nproperties are shown to depend only on qualitative features of the IWP\ndistribution: modality (number of maxima), smoothness and type of support\n(compact or infinite). The main results are summarized as phase diagrams in the\nspace of the model parameters, on which the regions of multiple equilibria are\nprecisely delimited.\n",

This is in sharp contrast to the CeRh1-xIrxIn5 system,\nwhere both the commensurate and incommensurate magnetic orders coexist with the\nsuperconductivity.

        "abstract": "  Heavy-ion reactions induced by neutron-rich nuclei provide a unique means to\ninvestigate the equation of state of isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter,\nespecially the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy. In\nparticular, recent analyses of the isospin diffusion data in heavy-ion\nreactions have already put a stringent constraint on the nuclear symmetry\nenergy around the nuclear matter saturation density. We review this exciting\nresult and discuss its implications on nuclear effective interactions and the\nneutron skin thickness of heavy nuclei. In addition, we also review the\ntheoretical progress on probing the high density behaviors of the nuclear\nsymmetry energy in heavy-ion reactions induced by high energy radioactive\nbeams.\n",

Our results show that the persistence length of\nthe DNA-drug complexes increases strongly as the drug concentration increases\nup to some critical value. Above this critical value, the persistence length\ndecreases abruptly and remains practically constant for larger drug\nconcentrations. The contour length of the molecules increases monotonically and\nsaturates as drugs concentration increases.

The canonical partition functions corresponding to\nthe different quark number sectors are expressed in the low temperature limit\nas polynomials of the eigenvalues of the reduced fermion matrix. Taking the\nzero temperature limit yields the masses of the lowest states. The method is\nsuccessfully applied to the Goldstone pion and both dynamical and quenched\nresults are presented showing good agreement with that of standard\nspectroscopy. Though in principle the method can be used to obtain the baryon\nand dibaryon masses, due to their high computational costs such calculations\nare practically unreachable.\n",

The heavy quarks, one in\neach hadron, are treated as static. Then, the energies give rise to an\nadiabatic potential Va(r) which we use to study the structure of the five-quark\nsystem. The simulation is based on an anisotropic and asymmetric lattice with\nWilson fermions. Energies are extracted from spectral density functions\nobtained with the maximum entropy method. Our results are meant to give\nqualitative insight: Using the resulting adiabatic potential in a Schroedinger\nequation produces bound state wave functions which indicate that the ground\nstate of the five-quark system resembles a hadronic molecule, whereas the first\nexcited state, having a very small rms radius, is probably better described as\na five-quark cluster, or a pentaquark. We hypothesize that an all light-quark\npentaquark may not exist, but in the heavy-quark sector it might, albeit only\nas an excited state.\n",

Starting with $N$ independent BECs we couple the\ncondensates through Josephson links and allow the system to reach a stable\ncirculation by adding a dissipative term in our semiclassical equations of\nmotion. The central question we address is what is the probability to trap a\nvortex with winding number $m$. Our numerical simulations reveal that the final\ndistribution of winding numbers is narrower than the initial distribution of\ntotal phases, indicating an increased probability for no-vortex configurations.\nFurther, the nonlinearity of the problem manifests itself in the somewhat\ncounter-intuitive result that it is possible to obtain a non-zero circulation\nstarting with zero total phase around the loop. The final width of the\ndistribution of winding numbers for $N$ sites scales as $\\lambda N^{\\alpha}$,\nwhere $\\alpha=0.47\\pm 0.01$ and $\\lambda <0.67$ (value predicted for the\ninitial distribution) indicating a shrinking of the final distribution. The\nactual value of $\\lambda$ is found to depend on the strength of dissipation.\n",

        "abstract": "  Using a semi-classical approach, we describe an on-chip cooling protocol for\na micro-mechanical resonator by employing a superconducting flux qubit. A\nLorentz force, generated by the passive back-action of the resonator's\ndisplacement, can cool down the thermal motion of the mechanical resonator by\napplying an appropriate microwave drive to the qubit. We show that this onchip\ncooling protocol, with well-controlled cooling power and a tunable response\ntime of passive back-action, can be highly efficient. With feasible\nexperimental parameters, the effective mode temperature of a resonator could be\ncooled down by several orders of magnitude.\n",

        "abstract": "  Prominent ethical and policy issues such as affirmative action and female\nenrollment in science and engineering revolve around the idea that diversity is\ngood. However, even though diversity is an ambiguous concept, a precise\ndefinition is seldom provided. We show that diversity may be construed as a\nfactual description, a craving for symmetry, an intrinsic good, an instrumental\ngood, a symptom, or a side effect. These acceptions differ vastly in their\nnature and properties. The first one cannot lead to any action and the second\none is mistaken. Diversity as intrinsic good is a mere opinion, which cannot be\nconcretely applied; moreover, the most commonly invoked forms of diversity\n(sexual and racial) are not intrinsically good. On the other hand, diversity as\ninstrumental good can be evaluated empirically and can give rise to policies,\nbut these may be very weak. Finally, symptoms and side effects are not actually\nabout diversity. We consider the example of female enrollment in science and\nengineering, interpreting the various arguments found in the literature in\nlight of this polysemy.\n  Keywords: ethics, policy, higher education, female students, minority\nstudents, affirmative action\n",

The model is based on the\nlength gauge version of the molecular strong-field approximation and is valid\nfor pulses shorter than 50 fs where the process of dissociation prior to\nionization is negligible. The results are compared with recent experimental\nresults for the proton energy spectrum [I. Ben-Itzhak et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.\n95, 073002 (2005), B. D. Esry et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 013003 (2006)]. The\npredictions of the model reproduce the profile of the spectrum although the\npeak energy is slightly lower than the observations. For comparison, we also\npresent results obtained by two different tunneling models for this process.\n",

        "abstract": "  The main objective of this work is to investigate theoretically how tilting\nof an easy axis of a single-molecule magnet (SMM) from the orientation\ncollinear with magnetic moments of the leads affects the switching process\ninduced by current flowing through the system. To do this we consider a model\nsystem that consists of a SMM embedded in the nonmagnetic barrier of a magnetic\ntunnel junction. The anisotropy axis of the SMM forms an arbitrary angle with\nmagnetic moments of the leads (the latter ones are assumed to be collinear).\nThe reversal of the SMM's spin takes place due to exchange interaction between\nthe molecule and electrons tunneling through the barrier. The current flowing\nthrough the system as well as the average z-component of the SMM's spin are\ncalculated in the second-order perturbation description (Fermi golden rule).\n",

        "abstract": "  The threshold electrodisintegration of the deuteron at backward angles is\nstudied with a relativistic Hamiltonian, including a relativistic\none-pion-exchange potential (OPEP) with off-shell terms as predicted by\npseudovector coupling of pions to nucleons. The bound and scattering states are\nobtained in the center-of-mass frame, and then boosted from it to the Breit\nframe, where the evaluation of the relevant matrix elements of the\nelectromagnetic current operator is carried out. The latter includes, in\naddition to one-body, also two-body terms due to pion exchange, as obtained,\nconsistently with the OPEP, in pseudovector pion-nucleon coupling theory. The\nfull Lorentz structure of these currents is retained. In order to estimate the\nmagnitude of the relativistic effects we perform, for comparison, the\ncalculation with a non-relativistic phase-equivalent Hamiltonian and the\nstandard non-relativistic expressions for the one-body and two-body\npion-exchange currents. Our results for the electrodisintegration cross section\nshow that, in the calculations using one-body currents, relativistic\ncorrections become significant ({\\it i.e.}, larger than 10%) only at high\nmomentum transfer $Q$ ($Q^2 \\simeq 40$fm$^{-2}$ and beyond). However, the\ninclusion of two-body currents makes the relativistic predictions considerably\nsmaller than the corresponding non-relativistic results in the $Q^2$ region\n(18--40) fm$^{-2}$. The calculations based on the relativistic model also\nconfirm the inadequacy, already established in a non-relativistic context, of\nthe present electromagnetic current model to reproduce accurately the\nexperimental data at intermediate values of momentum transfers.\n",

More specifically, does there exist a\nclass of V-Langevin equations with long-range (algebraic) velocity temporal\ncorrelation, that leads to a time-fractional superdiffusive process? The answer\nis always affirmative in one dimension. It is always negative in two\ndimensions: any algebraically decaying temporal velocity correlation (with a\nGaussian spatial correlation) produces a normal diffusive process. General\nconditions relating the diffusive nature of the process to the temporal\nexponent of the Lagrangian velocity correlation (in Corrsin approximation) are\nderived.\n",

The author method has two working versions: (1) the\nfirst variant the warm (hot) atmospheric air is lifted by the inflatable tube\nin a high altitude and atmospheric steam is condenced into freswater: (2) in\nthe second version, the warm air is pumped 20-30 meters under the sea-surface.\nIn the first version, wind and solar heating of air are used for causing air\nflow. In version (2) wind and propeller are used for causing air movment.\n  The first method does not need energy, the second needs a small amount.\nMoreover, in variant (1) the freshwater has a high pressure (>30 or more atm.)\nand can be used for production of energy such as electricity and in that way\nthe freshwater cost is lower. For increasing the productivity the seawater is\ninjected into air and solar air heater may be used. The solar air heater\nproduces a huge amount of electricity as a very powerful electricity generation\nplant. The offered electricity installation in 100 - 200 times cheaper than any\ncommon electric plant of equivalent output.\n  Key words: Extraction freshwater, method of getting freshwater, receiving\nenergy from atmosphere, powerful renewal electric plant.\n",

        "abstract": "  We are suggesting an electronic method for Cooper pair mass spectroscopy of\nthin superconducting films. The method can be applied, for example, for 100 nm\nthin high-T_c films grown on insulator substrate 10 mm X 10 mm. In Corbino\ngeometry two Ohmic contacts have to be made on the film evaporating Ag or using\nsilver paste: one circle with radius r_a (1) and a ring electrode with internal\nradius r_b (2). In the in-between space (r_a,r_b) a ring electrode from mylar\nassures a capacitive connection between the superconducting layer and the\nmetallized surface (3) of the mylar. In such a way we have an field effect\ntransistor (FET) type structure with a circular gate. When at low enough\ntemperatures T << T_c an AC current with frequency omega is applied between the\ncircle source (1) and the ring-shaped drain (2) an AC Bernoulli voltage with\ndouble frequency 2f appears between the gate (3) and the source (1). The 2f\nsignal depends on Cooper pair effective mass and its systematic investigation\ngives a Cooper pair mass spectroscopy. In the normal phase 2f gives logarithmic\nderivative of the density of states (DOS) with respect of Fermi energy.\nApplying a gate voltage in the same structure gives the mobility of the normal\nphase.\n",

The standard but heuristic tadpole improvement emerges from a mean\nfield approximation from the new approach. Scaling is investigated by means of\nthe large distance static quark potential. Both, the generic and the new\ntadpole scheme yield significant improvements on asymptotic scaling when\ncompared with loop improved actions. A study of the rotational symmetry\nbreaking terms, however, reveals that only the new improvement scheme\nefficiently eliminates the leading irrelevant term from the action.\n",

        "abstract": "  I consider the question of the interaction between a QCD string and the spin\nof a quark or an antiquark on whose worldline the string terminates. The\nproblem is analysed from the point of view of a string representation for the\nexpectation value of a Wilson loop for a spin-half particle. A string\nrepresentation of the super Wilson loop is obtained starting from an effective\nstring representation of a Wilson Loop. The action obtained in this manner is\ninvariant under a worldline supersymmetry and has a boundary term which\ncontains the spin-string interaction. For rectangular loops the spin-string\ninteraction vanishes and there is no spin-spin term in the resulting heavy\nquark potential. On the other hand if an allowance is made for the finite\nintrinsic thickness of the flux-tube, by assuming that the spin-string\ninteraction takes place not just at the boundary of the string world-sheet but\nextends to a distance of the order of the intrinsic thickness of the flux tube,\nthen we do obtain a spin-spin interaction which falls as the fifth power of the\ndistance. Such a term was previously suggested by Kogut and Parisi in the\ncontext of a flux-tube model of confinement.\n",

        "abstract": "  We perform a quantitative analysis of extensive chess databases and show that\nthe frequencies of opening moves are distributed according to a power-law with\nan exponent that increases linearly with the game depth, whereas the pooled\ndistribution of all opening weights follows Zipf's law with universal exponent.\nWe propose a simple stochastic process that is able to capture the observed\nplaying statistics and show that the Zipf law arises from the self-similar\nnature of the game tree of chess. Thus, in the case of hierarchical\nfragmentation the scaling is truly universal and independent of a particular\ngenerating mechanism. Our findings are of relevance in general processes with\ncomposite decisions.\n",

        "abstract": "  Measurements of thermal excitations of V-O and Y-Ba-Cu-O solid solutions have\nbeen performed by a method of inelastic neutron scattering for low-energy\ntransfers range. Features at energy transfer about 3meV and about 5meV for V-O\nand Y-Ba-Cu-O accordingly were observed in neutron scattering spectra. The\nreason of appearance of the observed low-energy excitations are the formation\nof an effective potential of oxygen with broad weakly upwards bottom at the xy\nplane of tetragonal symmetry octahedron, which the interstitial atom occupies.\nThe experimental observed features can be understood in the representation of\nhindered quantum gyration of the interstitial atom. It was assumed that O1 and\nO4 atoms in Y-Ba-Cu-O, as well as in V-O system, are in two-dimensional\nquantum-well, which has almost flat bottom formed by the surrounding atoms Cu\nand Ba. The possibility of formation of collective excitations of gyration-type\nas a result of exchange interaction of light atoms in matrix lattice is\nconsidered. The assumption is made that the existence of gyration-like\nexcitations can play an important role for explanation of some phenomena in\nsolid state physics, in particular in realization of high values of\ntemperatures of superconducting transitions in high temperature\nsuperconductors.\n",

At low-energy the scattering forms a cone of spin excitations\nemanating from the antiferromagnetic (0.5, 0.5) wave vector with an acoustic\nvelocity similar to that of insulating cuprates. At high energy transfers,\nbelow the maximum energy of 270 meV at (0.5, 0), we observe zone boundary\ndispersion much larger and spectral weight loss more extensive than in\ninsulating antiferromagnets. Moreover we report phenomena not found in\ninsulators, an overall lowering of the zone-boundary energies and a large\ndamping of $\\sim$ 100 meV of the spin excitations at high-energies. The energy\nabove which the damping occurs coincides approximately with the gap determined\nfrom transport measurements. We propose that as the energy is raised the spin\nexcitations encounter an extra channel of decay into particle-hole pairs of a\ncontinuum that we associate with the pseudogap.\n",

In each of the two descriptions a least square fit procedure is\nadopted.\n  Both expressions provide a surprisingly good agreement with the experimental\ndata.\n",

        "abstract": "  How do blogs cite and influence each other? How do such links evolve? Does\nthe popularity of old blog posts drop exponentially with time? These are some\nof the questions that we address in this work. Our goal is to build a model\nthat generates realistic cascades, so that it can help us with link prediction\nand outlier detection.\n  Blogs (weblogs) have become an important medium of information because of\ntheir timely publication, ease of use, and wide availability. In fact, they\noften make headlines, by discussing and discovering evidence about political\nevents and facts. Often blogs link to one another, creating a publicly\navailable record of how information and influence spreads through an underlying\nsocial network. Aggregating links from several blog posts creates a directed\ngraph which we analyze to discover the patterns of information propagation in\nblogspace, and thereby understand the underlying social network. Not only are\nblogs interesting on their own merit, but our analysis also sheds light on how\nrumors, viruses, and ideas propagate over social and computer networks.\n  Here we report some surprising findings of the blog linking and information\npropagation structure, after we analyzed one of the largest available datasets,\nwith 45,000 blogs and ~ 2.2 million blog-postings. Our analysis also sheds\nlight on how rumors, viruses, and ideas propagate over social and computer\nnetworks. We also present a simple model that mimics the spread of information\non the blogosphere, and produces information cascades very similar to those\nfound in real life.\n",

This model\nconsists of the capture process in the two-body potential pocket, which is\nfollowed by the penetration of the adiabatic one-body potential to reach a\ncompound state after the touching configuration. We describe the former process\nwith the coupled-channels framework, while the latter with the WKB\napproximation by taking into account the coordinate dependent inertia mass. The\neffect of the one-body barrier is important at incident energies below the\npotential energy at the touching configuration. We show that this model well\naccounts for the steep fall-off phenomenon of fusion cross sections at deep\nsubbarrier energies for the $^{64}$Ni+$^{64}$Ni and $^{58}$Ni+$^{58}$Ni\nreactions.\n",

To\nclarify the situation, we copy the main comment from an anonymous referee here:\n\"To my understanding, the authors analyze i = 1 ... 63 time series and\ncalculate their mean and standard deviation. These time series correspond to\nindividual, single ignition processes. Is this correct? If yes, these\nprocesses, as Fig. 3 shows very clearly, are not stationary, and the pressure\ndifference (i.e., the signal) quickly decays to zero. In this case both the\nmean and the standard deviation are poorly defined, for example because both\ndepend in a trivial fashion on the observation period T. I am not aware of any\nstudy (including those cited by the authors) which allows for any conclusion\nfrom such non-stationary signals. The results of Menezes and Barabasi are\nstrictly only valid for stationary time series, and they cannot be applied at\nall in this case.\" We agree with this insightful comment that our data are not\nstationary and the method adopted in our manuscript does not apply. We do not\nsee any possibility to correct this error and decide to withdraw it. We would\nlike to thank gratefully the referee and apologize for any inconvenience caused\nby our oversight.\n",

The\nequations for the one- and two-body cluster amplitudes are presented in a\nfactorized form that leads to an efficient numerical implementation. We employ\nlow-momentum two- and three-nucleon interactions and calculate the binding\nenergy of He-4. The results show that the main contribution of the\nthree-nucleon interaction stems from its density-dependent zero-, one-, and\ntwo-body terms that result from the normal ordering of the Hamiltonian in\ncoupled-cluster theory. The residual three-body terms that remain after normal\nordering can be neglected.\n",

This paper presents a\ntime-dependent extension of the GC method as a new approach to improve existing\napproximations of the exchange-correlation (XC) potential in time-dependent\ndensity-functional theory (TDDFT). The time-dependent GC method is shown to be\na conceptually and computationally simple tool to build memory effects into any\nexisting adiabatic XC potential. As an illustration, the method is applied to\ndriven parametric oscillations of two interacting electrons in a harmonic\npotential (Hooke's atom). It is demonstrated that a proper choice of\ntime-dependent generator coordinates in conjunction with the adiabatic\nlocal-density approximation reproduces the exact linear and nonlinear\ntwo-electron dynamics quite accurately, including features associated with\ndouble excitations that cannot be captured by TDDFT in the adiabatic\napproximation.\n",

Based on an extensive dataset of intermarriage statistics our\nstudy questions the legitimacy of such characterizations. It suggests that, far\nfrom being group-dependent, segregation mechanisms are instead\nsituation-dependent. More precisely, the degree of integration of a minority in\nterms of the frequency of intermarriage is seen to crucially depend upon the\nthe proportion p of the minority. Thus, a population may have a segregative\nbehavior with respect to a high-p (p>20%) minority A and at the same time a\ntolerant attitude toward a low-p (p<2%) minority B. This remains true even when\nA and B represent the same minority; for instance Black-White intermarriage is\nmuch more frequent in Montana than it is in South Carolina. In short, the\nnature of minority groups is largely irrelevant, the key factor being their\nproportion in a given area.\n",

The inclusion of pairing is instrumental for describing a\nnumber of experimentally measured spherical systems which are characterized by\nopen shells. We discuss the effect of isoscalar and isovector pairing\ncorrelations. Based on the results for the Gamow-Teller resonance in $^{90}$Zr,\nin $^{208}$Pb and in few Sn isotopes, we draw definite conclusions on the\nperformance of different Skyrme parametrizations, and we suggest improvements\nfor future fits. We also use the spin-dipole resonance as a benchmark of our\nstatements.\n",

Analytical results indicate that the resulting networks have\npower-law distributions of degree, strength, weight and betweenness, a\nscale-free behavior for degree correlations, logarithmic small average path\nlength and diameter with network size. The obtained properties are in agreement\nwith empirical data observed in many real-life networks, which shows that the\npresented model may provide valuable insight into the real systems.\n",

        "abstract": "  In recent times there has been a surge of interest in seeking out patterns in\nthe aggregate behavior of socio-economic systems. One such domain is the\nemergence of statistical regularities in the evolution of collective choice\nfrom individual behavior. This is manifested in the sudden emergence of\npopularity or \"success\" of certain ideas or products, compared to their\nnumerous, often very similar, competitors. In this paper, we present an\nempirical study of a wide range of popularity distributions, spanning from\nscientific paper citations to movie gross income. Our results show that in the\nmajority of cases, the distribution follows a log-normal form, suggesting that\nmultiplicative stochastic processes are the basis for emergence of popular\nentities. This suggests the existence of some general principles of complex\norganization leading to the emergence of popularity. We discuss the theoretical\nprinciples needed to explain this socio-economic phenomenon, and present a\nmodel for collective behavior that exhibits bimodality, which has been observed\nin certain empirical popularity distributions.\n",

The destruction of the band\ninsulator is driven by the energy gain in promoting fermions from valance band\nto various conducting bands to form Cooper pairs. We show that the transition\nmust take place in rather shallow lattice height, $V_{o}/E_{R}$ between 2.23\nand 4.14. The latter is the prediction of mean field theory while the former is\nthe value for opening a band gap. As one moves across resonance to the molecule\nside, the SF-BI transition evolves into the SF-Mott insulator transition of\nbosonic molecules. We shall also present the global phase diagram for\nSF-Insulator transition for the BCS-BEC family.\n",

When the temperature decreases, the transition to\nthe ordering state due to formation of the electron--hole pairs is possible\n(similar to the ordinary state of the excitonic insulator). The properties of\nthe state at zero temperature are investigated. The spectrum of elementary\nexcitations has a gap, and so the conclusion can be made that obtained state is\nsuperconducting one. Thus, depending on the external conditions, excitonic\ninsulator behaves itself like the insulator or superconductor. That is correct\nin the limit of strong overlapping of the electron--hole pairs.\n",

        "abstract": "  In this paper, it is shown that the cosmological model that was introduced in\na sequence of three earlier papers under the title, A Dust Universe Solution to\nthe Dark Energy Problem, can be used to resolve the problem of the great\nmismatch of numerical values between dark energy from cosmology and zero point\nenergy from quantum theory. It is shown that, if the zero point energies for\nthe cosmic microwave background and for all the rest of the universe that is\nnot cosmic microwave background are introduced into this model as two entities,\ntheir separate values appear within this theory in the form of a numerical\ndifference. It is this difference that gives the numerical value for the zero\npoint value of Einstein's dark energy density. Consequently, although the two\nzero point energies may be large, their difference can give the known small\ndark energy value from cosmology for dark energy density. Issues relating to\ninterpretation, calculation and measurement associated with this result and an\ninterpretation of dark energy as a measure of polarisation of the vacuum are\ndiscussed. In the first appendix to this paper, problems associated with the\nstandard model of cosmology are solved by redefining temperature in the dust\nuniverse model. In the second appendix of this paper, an examination of the\ndark matter problem in relation to a general relativistic generalisation of\nNewton's inverse square law is undertaken. In the third appendix to this paper,\nthe formalism is used to derive a formula that gives a possible value for the\nmass of the universe in terms of Newton's gravitation constant, Einstein's\nLambda and the velocity of light. All three appendices have their own detailed\nabstracts.\n",

From the build up partition function we derive various thermodynamical\ncharacteristics for alanine polypeptides of different length as a function of\ntemperature. Thus, we analyze the temperature dependence of the heat capacity,\nlatent heat and helicity for alanine polypeptides consisting of 21, 30, 40, 50\nand 100 amino acids. Alternatively, we have obtained same thermodynamical\ncharacteristics from the use of molecular dynamics simulations and compared\nthem with the results of the new statistical mechanics approach. The comparison\nproves the validity of the statistical mechanic approach and establishes its\naccuracy.\n",

The behavior of these volumes is strongly influenced by the\nregular or chaotic nature of the motion, the number of deviation vectors, their\nlinear (in)dependence and the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents. The different\ntime evolution of these volumes can be used to identify rapidly and efficiently\nthe nature of the dynamics, leading to the introduction of quantities that\nclearly distinguish between chaotic behavior and quasiperiodic motion on\n$N$-dimensional tori. More specifically we introduce the Generalized Alignment\nIndex of order $k$ (GALI$_k$) as the volume of a generalized parallelepiped,\nwhose edges are $k$ initially linearly independent unit deviation vectors from\nthe studied orbit whose magnitude is normalized to unity at every time step.\nThe GALI$_k$ is a generalization of the Smaller Alignment Index (SALI)\n(GALI$_2$ $\\propto$ SALI). However, GALI$_k$ provides significantly more\ndetailed information on the local dynamics, allows for a faster and clearer\ndistinction between order and chaos than SALI and works even in cases where the\nSALI method is inconclusive.\n",

        "abstract": "  We show that the van der Waals-like phase separation instability of a driven\ngranular gas at zero gravity, previously investigated in two-dimensional\nsettings, persists in three dimensions. We consider a monodisperse granular gas\ndriven by a thermal wall of a three-dimensional rectangular container at zero\ngravity. The basic steady state of this system, as described by granular\nhydrodynamic equations, involves a denser and colder layer of granulate located\nat the wall opposite to the driving wall. When the inelastic energy loss is\nsufficiently high, the driven granular gas exhibits, in some range of average\ndensities, negative compressibility in the directions parallel to the driving\nwall. When the lateral dimensions of the container are sufficiently large, the\nnegative compressibility causes spontaneous symmetry breaking of the basic\nsteady state and a phase separation instability. Event-driven molecular\ndynamics simulations confirm and complement our theoretical predictions.\n",

Various quantities\nare calculated to all orders in perturbation theory exploiting the one-loop\nsaturation of the effective action in the large-N limit. The fuzzy sphere\nbecomes unstable at sufficiently strong coupling, and the critical point is\nobtained explicitly as a function of the temperature. The whole phase diagram\nis investigated by Monte Carlo simulation. Above the critical point, we obtain\nperfect agreement with the all order results. In the region below the critical\npoint, which is not accessible by perturbation theory, we observe the Hagedorn\ntransition. In the high temperature limit our model is equivalent to a totally\nreduced model, and the relationship to previously known results is clarified.\n",

The complex problem was reduced to a\nlow-dimensional scanning along a selected distance between the protein and the\nligand. Orientational coordinates of the escaping fragment (the ligand) were\nalso assessed in order to further characterise the unbinding. Solvent effects\nwere accounted for by means of the Poisson--Boltzmann continuum model. The\ncorresponding dissociation time was derived from the calculated barrier height,\nin compliance with the experimentally reported Arrhenius-like behaviour.

The important issue of the self-consistent initial conditions\nis addressed by analyzing the initial charging transient due to the electron\nexpansion, in the approximation of immobile ions. A comparison among different\nkinetic models for the expansion is presented, showing that the ergodic model\nprovides a simplified description, which retains the essential information on\nthe electron distribution, in particular, the energy spectrum. Results are\npresented for a wide range of initial conditions (determined from a single\ndimensionless parameter), in excellent agreement with calculations from the\nexact Vlasov-Poisson theory, thus providing a complete and detailed\ncharacterization of all the stages of the expansion.\n",

        "abstract": "  A general {\\it ab-initio} and non-perturbative method to solve the\ntime-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation (TDSE) for the interaction of a strong\nattosecond laser pulse with a general atom, i.e., beyond the models of\nquasi-one-electron or quasi-two-electron targets, is described. The field-free\nHamiltonian and the dipole matrices are generated using a flexible $B$-spline\n$R$-matrix method. This numerical implementation enables us to construct\nterm-dependent, non-orthogonal sets of one-electron orbitals for the bound and\ncontinuum electrons. The solution of the TDSE is propagated in time using the\nArnoldi-Lanczos method, which does not require the diagonalization of any large\nmatrices. The method is illustrated by an application to the multi-photon\nexcitation and ionization of Ne atoms. Good agreement with $R$-matrix Floquet\ncalculations for the generalized cross sections for two-photon ionization is\nachieved.\n",

However, forward integrators are also better\nin solving time-reversible equations of classical dynamics by tracking as\nclosely as possible the physical trajectory. This work compares in detail\nvarious forward and non-forward fourth-order integrators using three, fourth,\nfive and six force evaluations.

In\np-wave systems involving the mixture of two-hyperfine states, we show that the\ninterference pattern exhibits a polarization effect depending on the relative\norientation of the two vector order parameters. Lastly, we also point out that\np-wave Fermi condensates exhibit an anisotropic expansion, reflecting the\nspatial anisotropy of the underlying interaction between fermions and the\norbital nature of the vector order parameter. Potential applications of our\nresults include systems of ultra-cold atoms that exhibit p-wave Feshbach\nresonances such as 6Li or 40K.\n",

Residual correlations between photons from pion decays\nare considered as a new possible source of information on direct photon\nfraction. Residual correlations in $p\\gamma$ and $p\\Lambda$ systems due to\n$p\\Sigma^0$ interaction in final state are predicted based on the $p\\Sigma^0$\nlow energy scattering parameters deduced from the spin-flavour SU$_6$ model by\nFujiwara et al. including effective meson exchange potentials and explicit\nflavour symmetry breaking to reproduce the properties of the two-nucleon system\nand the low-energy hyperon-nucleon cross section data. The $p\\gamma_{\\Sigma^0}$\nresidual correlation is concentrated at $k^* \\approx 70$ Mev/$c$ and its shape\nand intensity appears to be sensitive to the scattering parameters and\nspace-time dimensions of the source. The $p\\Lambda_{\\Sigma^0}$ residual\ncorrelation recovers the negative parent $p\\Sigma^0$ correlation for $k^* > 70$\nMev/$c$. The neglect of this negative residual correlation would lead to the\nunderestimation of the parent $p\\Lambda$ correlation effect and to an\noverestimation of the source size.\n",

        "abstract": "  In mesoscopic two-gap superconductors with sizes of the order of the\ncoherence length noncomposite vortices are found to be thermodynamically stable\nin a large domain of the $T - H$ phase diagram. In these phases the vortex\ncores of one condensate are spatially separated from the other condensate ones,\nand their respective distributions can adopt distinct symmetries. The\nappearance of these vortex phases is caused by a non-negligible effect of the\nboundary of the sample on the superconducting order parameter and represents\ntherefore a genuine mesoscopic effect. For low values of interband Josephson\ncoupling vortex patterns with $L_1 \\neq L_2$ can arise in addition to the\nphases with $L_1 =L_2$, where $L_1$ and $L_2$ are total vorticities in the two\ncondensates. The calculations show that noncomposite vortices could be observed\nin thin mesoscopic samples of MgB$_{2}$.\n",

A viscous correction is added not only to the irrotational\npressure (Bernoulli's equation), but also to the kinematic boundary condition.\nThe nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (NLS) equation that one can derive from the new set\nof equations to describe the modulations of weakly nonlinear, weakly damped\ndeep-water gravity waves turns out to be the classical damped version of the\nNLS equation that has been used by many authors without rigorous justification.\n",

It has been predicted that\nsuperconductors with broken time reversal symmetry should have spontaneously\ngenerated supercurrents at edges and domain walls. We have done careful imaging\nof the magnetic fields above Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ single crystals using scanning Hall\nbar and SQUID microscopies, and see no evidence for such spontaneously\ngenerated supercurrents. We use the results from our magnetic imaging to place\nupper limits on the spontaneously generated supercurrents at edges and domain\nwalls as a function of domain size. For a single domain, this upper limit is\nbelow the predicted signal by two orders of magnitude. We speculate on the\ncauses and implications of the lack of large spontaneous supercurrents in this\nvery interesting superconducting system.\n",

        "abstract": "  Multicanonical molecular dynamics (MD) is a powerful technique for sampling\nconformations on rugged potential surfaces such as protein. However, it is\nnotoriously difficult to estimate the multicanonical temperature effectively.\nWang and Landau developed a convenient method for estimating the density of\nstates based on a multicanonical Monte Carlo method. In their method, the\ndensity of states is calculated autonomously during a simulation. In this paper\nwe develop a set of techniques to effectively apply the Wang-Landau method to\nMD simulations. In the multicanonical MD, the estimation of the derivative of\nthe density of states is critical. In order to estimate it accurately, we\ndevise two original improvements. First, the correction for the density of\nstates is made smooth by using the Gaussian distribution obtained by a short\ncanonical simulation. Second, an approximation is applied to the derivative,\nwhich is based on the Gaussian distribution and the multiple weighted histogram\ntechnique. A test of this method was performed with small polypeptides,\nMet-enkephalin and Trp-cage, and it is demonstrated that Wang-Landau MD is\nconsistent with replica exchange MD but can sample much larger conformational\nspace.\n",

Two kinds of junctions are considered: a chaotic dot\ncoupled to superconductors by tunnel barriers and a diffusive junction with\ntransparent normal--superconducting interfaces. The amplitude of current\nfluctuations and the weak localization correction to the average current are\ncalculated as functions of the ratio between the superconducting gap and the\nelectron dwell energy, temperature, and superconducting phase difference across\nthe junction. Technically, fluctuations on top of the spatially inhomogeneous\nproximity effect in the normal region are described by the replicated version\nof the \\sigma-model. For the case of diffusive junctions with transparent\ninterfaces, the magnitude of mesoscopic fluctuations of the critical current\nappears to be nearly 3 times larger than the prediction of the previous theory\nwhich did not take the proximity effect into account.\n",

        "abstract": "  The symmetric heavy-light ansatz is a method for finding the ground state of\nany dilute unpolarized system of attractive two-component fermions.\nOperationally it can be viewed as a generalization of the Kohn-Sham equations\nin density functional theory applied to N-body density correlations. While the\noriginal Hamiltonian has an exact Z_2 symmetry, the heavy-light ansatz breaks\nthis symmetry by skewing the mass ratio of the two components. In the limit\nwhere one component is infinitely heavy, the many-body problem can be solved in\nterms of single-particle orbitals. The original Z_2 symmetry is recovered by\nenforcing Z_2 symmetry as a constraint on N-body density correlations for the\ntwo components. For the 1D, 2D, and 3D attractive Hubbard models the method is\nin very good agreement with exact Lanczos calculations for few-body systems at\narbitrary coupling. For the 3D attractive Hubbard model there is very good\nagreement with lattice Monte Carlo results for many-body systems in the limit\nof infinite scattering length.\n",

The paper presents a real-time\nalgorithm for perfecting turbulence degraded videos by means of stabilization\nand resolution enhancement. The latter is achieved by exploiting the turbulent\nmotion. The algorithm involves generation of a reference frame and estimation,\nfor each incoming video frame, of a local image displacement map with respect\nto the reference frame; segmentation of the displacement map into two classes:\nstationary and moving objects and resolution enhancement of stationary objects,\nwhile preserving real motion. Experiments with synthetic and real-life\nsequences have shown that the enhanced videos, generated in real time, exhibit\nsubstantially better resolution and complete stabilization for stationary\nobjects while retaining real motion.\n",

The main innovation is filling\nthe tower by electron gas, which can create pressure up one atmosphere, has\nnegligible small weight and surprising properties.\n  The suggested mast has following advantages in comparison with conventional\nspace elevator: 1. Electrostatic AB tower may be built from Earth surface\nwithout the employment of any rockets. That decreases the cost of electrostatic\nmast by thousands of times. 2. One can have any height and has a big control\nload capacity. 3. Electrostatic tower can have the height of a geosynchronous\norbit (36,000 km) WITHOUT the additional top cable as the space elevator (up\n120,000 - 160,000 km) and counterweight (equalizer) of hundreds of tons. 4. The\noffered mast has less total mass than conventional space elevator. 5. The\noffered tower can have the high-speed electrostatic climbers moved by\nhigh-voltage electricity from Earth's surface. 6. The electrostatic mast can\nbend in any needed direction when we give the necessary electric voltage in the\nrequired parts of the extended mast. 7. Control mast has stability for any\naltitude.

While this matrix is usually Hermitian, it becomes\nnon-Hermitian in the presence of a quark chemical potential. We show how the\naction of the sign function of a non-Hermitian matrix on an arbitrary vector\ncan be computed efficiently on large lattices by an iterative method. A Krylov\nsubspace approximation based on the Arnoldi algorithm is described for the\nevaluation of a generic matrix function. The efficiency of the method is\nspoiled when the matrix has eigenvalues close to a function discontinuity. This\nis cured by adding a small number of critical eigenvectors to the Krylov\nsubspace, for which we propose two different deflation schemes. The ensuing\nmodified Arnoldi method is then applied to the sign function, which has a\ndiscontinuity along the imaginary axis. The numerical results clearly show the\nimproved efficiency of the method. Our modification is particularly effective\nwhen the action of the sign function of the same matrix has to be computed many\ntimes on different vectors, e.g., if the overlap Dirac operator is inverted\nusing an iterative method.\n",

        "abstract": "  The effect of Li substitution for Mg and of Li-C co-substitution on the\nsuperconducting properties and crystal structure of MgB2 single crystals has\nbeen investigated. It has been found that hole doping with Li decreases the\nsuperconducting transition temperature Tc, but at a slower rate than electron\ndoping with C or Al. Tc of MgB2 crystals with simultaneously substituted Li for\nMg and C for B decreases more than in the case where C is substituted alone.\nThis means that holes introduced by Li cannot counterbalance the effect of\ndecrease of Tc caused by introduction of electrons coming from C. The possible\nreason of it can be that holes coming from Li occupy the pi band while\nelectrons coming from C fill the sigma band. The temperature dependences of the\nupper critical field Hc2 for Al and Li substituted crystals with the same Tc\nshow a similar dHc2/dT slope at Tc and a similar Hc2(T) behavior, despite of\nmuch different substitution level. This indicates that the mechanism\ncontrolling Hc2 and Tc is similar in both hole and electron doped crystals.\nElectrical transport measurements show an increase of resistivity both in Li\nsubstituted crystals and in Li and C co-substituted crystals. This indicates\nenhanced scattering due to defects introduced by substitutions including\ndistortion of the lattice. The observed behavior can be explained as a result\nof two effects, influencing both Tc and Hc2. The first one is doping related to\nthe changes in the carrier concentration, which may lead to the decrease or to\nthe increase of Tc. The second one is related to the introduction of new\nscattering centers leading to the modification of the interband and/or\nintraband scattering and therefore, to changes in the superconducting gaps and\nto the reduction of Tc.\n",

        "abstract": "  In this paper a lattice model for diffusional transport of particles in the\ninterphase cell nucleus is proposed. Dense networks of chromatin fibers are\ncreated by three different methods: randomly distributed, non-interconnected\nobstacles, a random walk chain model, and a self avoiding random walk chain\nmodel with persistence length. By comparing a discrete and a continuous version\nof the random walk chain model, we demonstrate that lattice discretization does\nnot alter particle diffusion. The influence of the 3D geometry of the fiber\nnetwork on the particle diffusion is investigated in detail, while varying\noccupation volume, chain length, persistence length and walker size. It is\nshown that adjacency of the monomers, the excluded volume effect incorporated\nin the self avoiding random walk model, and, to a lesser extent, the\npersistence length, affect particle diffusion. It is demonstrated how the\nintroduction of the effective chain occupancy, which is a convolution of the\ngeometric chain volume with the walker size, eliminates the conformational\neffects of the network on the diffusion, i.e., when plotting the diffusion\ncoefficient as a function of the effective chain volume, the data fall onto a\nmaster curve.\n",

When applied to highly charged ions\nconfined in Penning traps, these procedures are very effective for testing\nquantum electrodynamics in extreme electromagnetic fields produced by heavy\nhighly charged ions such as uranium U$^{91+}$. In addition, fundamental\nconstants or nuclear ground state properties can be determined with high\naccuracy in these simple systems. Finally, by studying a single trapped\nradioactive ion, its nuclear decay can be studied in detail by observing the\ndisappearance of the signal of the mother and the appearance of that of the\ndaughter isotope. Such experiments on highly charged ions at extremely low\nenergy will become possible by the HITRAP facility which is currently being\nbuilt up at GSI. Also the future Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research\n(FAIR) will be briefly described which is expected to be operational by 2014.\n",

We demonstrate\nthat the manipulation of the density of photonic states at the emission\nfrequency of the energy donor results in a change of the quantum efficiencies\nof the competing energy transfer and spontaneous emission processes. This\nchange will be manifested in a modification of the donor and acceptor emission\nintensities. Thus, by controlling the local density of photonic states Forster\ncoupled systems can be manipulated and analyzed without the need to physically\nseparate donor and acceptor chromophores for individual analysis, which is of\ninterest, for example, for oligomeric reef coral fluorescent proteins.\n",

In this study we\npresent a computational reconstruction approach to the problem of network\norganization, by considering the topological and spatial features of each area\nin the primate cerebral cortex as subsidy for the reconstruction of the global\ncortical network connectivity. Starting with all areas being disconnected,\npairs of areas with similar sets of features are linked together, in an attempt\nto recover the original network structure. Inferring primate cortical\nconnectivity from the properties of the nodes, remarkably good reconstructions\nof the global network organization could be obtained, with the topological\nfeatures allowing slightly superior accuracy to the spatial ones. Analogous\nreconstruction attempts for the C. elegans neuronal network resulted in\nsubstantially poorer recovery, indicating that cortical area interconnections\nare relatively stronger related to the considered topological and spatial\nproperties than neuronal projections in the nematode. The close relationship\nbetween area-based features and global connectivity may hint on developmental\nrules and constraints for cortical networks. Particularly, differences between\nthe predictions from topological and spatial properties, together with the\npoorer recovery resulting from spatial properties, indicate that the\norganization of cortical networks is not entirely determined by spatial\nconstraints.\n",

We find that the addition of poorly pinned\nparticles can increase the overall pinning in the sample by increasing the\namount of topological disorder present. If the quenched disorder is strong\nenough to create a significant amount of topological disorder in the\nmonodisperse system, addition of a poorly pinned species generates further\ndisorder but does not produce a peak in the depinning force. Our results\nindicate that for binary mixtures, optimal pinning occurs for topological\ndefect fraction densities of 0.2 to 0.25. For defect densities below this\nrange, the system retains orientational order. We determine the effect of the\npinning density, strength, and radius on the depinning peak and find that the\npeak effect is more pronounced in weakly pinning systems.\n",

Our\nnumerical simulations show that the ac dissipation is strongly dependent on the\norientation of the ac magnetic field ($h_{ac}$) relative to the dc magnetic\nfield ($H_{dc}$). When $h_{ac}$ is parallel to $H_{dc}$ we observe that each\nvortex penetration event produces a significant supression of the ac losses\nbecause the imaginary part of the ac susceptibility as a function of $H_{dc}$\nincreases before the penetration of vortices, and then it decreases abruptly\nafter vortices have entered into the sample. In the second case, when $h_{ac}$\nis perpendicular to $H_{dc}$, we observe that the jumps in dissipation occur at\nthe same values of $H_{dc}$ but are much smaller than in the parallel\nconfiguration. The behavior of the dissipation in the perpendicular\nconfiguration is similar to previous results obtained in recent microwave\nexperiments using mesoscopic litographed squares of Pb [J. Low Temp. Phys. 135,\n119 (2004)].\n",

We show that a single electron can very efficiently depolarize the\nnuclear spins and discuss two processes that can cause this depolarization.\nConversely, in the absence of a quantum dot electron, the lifetime of nuclear\nspin polarization is on the time scale of a second, most likely limited by the\nnon-secular terms of the nuclear dipole-dipole interaction.

To the order\nwe work at, these quantities are the 1S0 scattering length and effective range,\nthe deuteron binding energy, the 3S1 effective range, and the binding energy of\none three-nucleon bound state. The chiral EFT input we use has the inverse 3S1\nand 1S0 scattering lengths vanishing at mpi_c=197.8577 MeV. At this\n``critical'' pion mass, the triton has infinitely many excited states with an\naccumulation point at the three-nucleon threshold. We compute the binding\nenergies of these states up to next-to-next-to-leading order in the pionless\nEFT and study the convergence pattern of the EFT in the vicinity of the\ncritical pion mass. Furthermore, we use the pionless EFT to predict how doublet\nand quartet nd scattering lengths depend on mpi in the region between the\nphysical pion mass and mpi=mpi_c.\n",

        "abstract": "  Current methods for producing single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) lead to\nheterogeneous samples containing mixtures of metallic and semiconducting\nspecies with a variety of lengths and defects. Optical detection at the single\nnanotube level should thus offer the possibility to examine these\nheterogeneities provided that both SWNT species are equally well detected.\nHere, we used photothermal heterodyne detection to record absorption images and\nspectra of individual SWNTs. Because this photothermal method relies only on\nlight absorption, it readily detects metallic nanotubes as well as the emissive\nsemiconducting species. The first and second optical transitions in individual\nsemicontucting nanotubes have been probed. Comparison between the emission and\nabsorption spectra of the lowest-lying optical transition reveal mainly small\nStokes shifts. Side bands in the near-infrared absorption spectra are observed\nand assigned to exciton-phonon bound states. No such sidebands are detected\naround the lowest transition of metallic nanotubes.\n",

        "abstract": "  Two approaches for closing the turbulence subgrid-scale stress tensor in\nterms of matrix exponentials are introduced and compared. The first approach is\nbased on a formal solution of the stress transport equation in which the\nproduction terms can be integrated exactly in terms of matrix exponentials.\nThis formal solution of the subgrid-scale stress transport equation is shown to\nbe useful to explore special cases, such as the response to constant velocity\ngradient, but neglecting pressure-strain correlations and diffusion effects.\nThe second approach is based on an Eulerian-Lagrangian change of variables,\ncombined with the assumption of isotropy for the conditionally averaged\nLagrangian velocity gradient tensor and with the `Recent Fluid Deformation'\n(RFD) approximation. It is shown that both approaches lead to the same basic\nclosure in which the stress tensor is expressed as the product of the matrix\nexponential of the resolved velocity gradient tensor multiplied by its\ntranspose. Short-time expansions of the matrix exponentials are shown to\nprovide an eddy-viscosity term and particular quadratic terms, and thus allow a\nreinterpretation of traditional eddy-viscosity and nonlinear stress closures.\nThe basic feasibility of the matrix-exponential closure is illustrated by\nimplementing it successfully in Large Eddy Simulation of forced isotropic\nturbulence. The matrix-exponential closure employs the drastic approximation of\nentirely omitting the pressure-strain correlation and other `nonlinear\nscrambling' terms. But unlike eddy-viscosity closures, the matrix exponential\napproach provides a simple and local closure that can be derived directly from\nthe stress transport equation with the production term, and using physically\nmotivated assumptions about Lagrangian decorrelation and upstream isotropy.\n",

The\nlateral shift of the rolls may lead to global flow reversal of the convective\nmotion. The chaotic traveling rolls are observed in simulation with {\\it\nfree-slip} as well as {\\it no-slip} boundary conditions on the velocity field.\nWe show that the traveling rolls and the flow reversal are due to an interplay\nbetween the real and imaginary parts of the critical modes.\n",

Through a toy model of random\nwalk/Brownian motion and memoryless renewal process (i.e. Poisson point\nprocess) of observation times we show that in case of analytical treatability,\nby decomposing the correlations we get the exact result for the frequency\ndependence. We also demonstrate that our approach produces reasonable fitting\nof the dependence of correlations on the data resolution in case of empirical\ndata. Our results indicate that the Epps phenomenon is a product of the finite\ntime decay of lagged correlations of high resolution data, which does not scale\nwith activity. The characteristic time is due to a human time scale, the time\nneeded to react to news.\n",

The key point for recording trajectories at video rate is the use of a\ntriangulation procedure. The effectiveness of the method is tested against\nSingle fluorescent Molecule Tracking in live COS7 cells on subsecond time\nscales. We further demonstrate recordings for several minutes of AMPA receptors\ntrajectories on the plasma membrane of live neurons.

Our theory follows a recent\nproposal of using phenomenological 2D modeling for the description of crossed\nfield dynamics in high-T$_c$ superconductors [{\\tt arXiv:cond-mat/0703330}].\n  Stationary regimes with either saturation to metastable configurations, or\ncomplete decay to the thermodynamic equilibrium are obtained. The transition\nbetween both types of response is related to the disappearance of a flux free\ncore within the sample. As a common feature, a step-like dependence in the time\nrelaxation is predicted for both cases. The theory may be applied to long bars\nof arbitrary and non homogeneous cross section, under in-plane magnetic field\nprocesses.\n",

        "abstract": "  Trafficking of glutamate receptors into and out of synapses is critically\ninvolved in the plasticity of excitatory synaptic transmission. Endocytosis and\nexocytosis of receptors have initially been thought to account alone for this\ntrafficking. However, membrane proteins also traffic through surface lateral\ndiffusion in the plasma membrane. We describe developments in\nelectrophysiological and optical approaches that have allowed for the real time\nmeasurement of glutamate receptor surface trafficking in live neurons. These\ninclude (i) specific imaging of surface receptors using a pH sensitive\nfluorescent protein, (ii) design of a photoactivable drug to inactivate locally\nsurface receptors and monitor electrophysiologically their recovery, and\n(iii)application of single molecule fluorescence microscopy to directly track\nthe movement of individual surface receptors with nanometer resolution inside\nand outside synapses. Altogether, these approaches have demonstrated that\nglutamate receptors diffuse at high rates in the neuronal membrane and suggest\na key role for surface diffusion in the regulation of receptor numbers at\nsynapses.\n",

        "abstract": "  In the last decade evidence has accumulated that small domains of 50-700 nm\nin diameter are located in the exoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane. Most\nof these domains supposedly consist of specific sets of lipids and proteins,\nand are believed to coordinate signal transduction cascades. Whether similar\ndomains are also present in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane is\nunclear so far. To investigate the presence of cytoplasmic leaflet domains, the\nH-Ras membrane-targeting sequence was fused to the C-terminus of the enhanced\nyellow fluorescent protein. Using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy,\ntrajectories of individual molecules diffusing in the cytoplasmic leaflet of\nthe plasma membrane were recorded. From these trajectories, the diffusion of\nindividual membrane-anchored enhanced yellow fluorescent protein molecules was\nstudied in live cells on timescales from 5 to 200 ms. The results show that the\ndiffusion of 30-40% of the molecules is constrained in domains with a typical\nsize of 200 nm. Neither breakdown of actin nor cholesterol extraction changed\nthe domain characteristics significantly, indicating that the observed domains\nmay not be related to the membrane domains identified so far.\n",

Previous studies have focused on the role of endo/exocytosis\nprocesses or that of lateral diffusion of extra-synaptic receptors. We have now\ndirectly imaged AMPAR movements inside and outside synapses of live neurons\nusing single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. Inside individual synapses, we\nfound immobile and mobile receptors, which display restricted diffusion.\nExtra-synaptic receptors display free diffusion. Receptors could also exchange\nbetween these membrane compartments through lateral diffusion. Glutamate\napplication increased both receptor mobility inside synapses and the fraction\nof mobile receptors present in a juxtasynaptic region. Block of inhibitory\ntransmission to favor excitatory synaptic activity induced a transient increase\nin the fraction of mobile receptors and a decrease in the proportion of\njuxtasynaptic receptors. Altogether, our data show that rapid exchange of\nreceptors between a synaptic and extra-synaptic localization occurs through\nregulation of receptor diffusion inside synapses.\n",

The spectrometer SPI on\nboard INTEGRAL has accumulated nearly three years of data on gamma-ray emission\nfrom the Galactic plane.

We detect the gamma-ray lines from 60Fe decay at\n1173 and 1333 keV, obtaining an improvement over our earlier measurement of\nboth lines with now 4.9 sigma significance for the combination of the two\nlines. The average flux per line is (4.4 \\pm 0.9) \\times 10^{-5} ph cm^{-2}\ns^{-1} rad^{-1} for the inner Galaxy region. Deriving the Galactic 26Al\ngamma-ray line flux with using the same set of observations and analysis\nmethod, we determine the flux ratio of 60Fe/26Al gamma-rays as 0.148 \\pm 0.06.\nThe current theoretical predictions are still consistent with our result.\n",

We will\nformulate these hypotheses more rigorously and present a simple chemical\nreaction model to test these hypotheses. With the help of this model, we will\nclearly demonstrate that there are different MaxEP hypotheses being discussed\nin the literature and we will look at some parts in the literature where these\ndifferences are not always clarified. Furthermore, our chemical model will be a\ngeneral counter example to all of these MaxEP and gradient response hypotheses.\n",

        "abstract": "  Interaction between metal surface waves and periodic geometry of\nsubwavelength structures is at the core of the recent but crucial renewal of\ninterest in plasmonics. One of the most intriguing points is the observation of\nabnormal strong transmission through these periodic structures, which can\nexceed by orders of magnitude the classical transmission given by the filling\nfactor of the plate. The actual paradigm is that this abnormal transmission\narises from the periodicity, and then that such high transmission should\ndisappear in random geometries. Here, we show that extra energy can be coupled\nthrough the subwavelength structure by adding a controlled quantity of noise to\nthe position of the apertures. This result can be modelled in the statistical\nframework of stochastic resonance. The evolution of the coupled energy with\nrespect to noise gives access to the extra energy coupled at the surface of the\nsubwavelength array.\n",

In the\nlast few years, researchers have made important steps toward understanding the\nqualitatively new critical phenomena in complex networks. We review the\nresults, concepts, and methods of this rapidly developing field. Here we mostly\nconsider two closely related classes of these critical phenomena, namely\nstructural phase transitions in the network architectures and transitions in\ncooperative models on networks as substrates. We also discuss systems where a\nnetwork and interacting agents on it influence each other. We overview a wide\nrange of critical phenomena in equilibrium and growing networks including the\nbirth of the giant connected component, percolation, k-core percolation,\nphenomena near epidemic thresholds, condensation transitions, critical\nphenomena in spin models placed on networks, synchronization, and\nself-organized criticality effects in interacting systems on networks. We also\ndiscuss strong finite size effects in these systems and highlight open problems\nand perspectives.\n",

        "abstract": "  We employ the Boltzmann equation for describing hadron production from a\nquark-gluon plasma (QGP) in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. We propose\nresonance formation in quark-antiquark scattering as the dominant\nmeson-production channel, which, in particular, ensures that energy is\nconserved in the recombination process. This, in turn, facilitates a more\ncontrolled extension of hadronization to low transverse momenta ($p_T$), and to\naddress the experimentally observed transition from a hydrodynamic regime to\nconstituent quark-number scaling (CQNS). Based on input distributions for\nstrange and charm quarks with azimuthal asymmetries, $v_2(p_T)$, characteristic\nfor RHIC energies, we recover CQNS at sufficiently high $p_T$, while at low\n$p_T$ a scaling with transverse kinetic energy is found, reminiscent to\nexperiment. The dependence of the transition regime on microscopic QGP\nproperties, i.e. resonance widths and $Q$-values in the $q+\\bar q \\to M$\nprocess, is elucidated.\n",

Generally however they are deemed undesirable and are forcibly\nexcluded, destroying the theory's inherent time-symmetry. We investigate the\nreason for this, pointing out that it is not necessary and in some cases is\ncounter-productive. We then focus on the direct-action theory in which the\nadvanced and retarded contributions are present symmetrically, with no\nopportunity to supplement the particular integral solution of the wave equation\nwith an arbitrary complementary function. One then requires a plausible\nexplanation for the observed broken symmetry that, commonly, is understood\ncannot be met by the Wheeler-Feynman mechanism because the necessary boundary\ncondition cannot be satisfied in acceptable cosmologies. We take this\nopportunity to argue that the boundary condition is already met by all\nexpanding cosmologies simply as a result of cosmological red-shift. A\nconsequence is that the cosmological and thermodynamic arrows of time can be\nequated, the direct action version of EM is preferred, and that advanced\npotentials are ubiquitous.\n",

        "abstract": "  Very recently, it has been shown that thermal noise and its artificial\nversions (Johnson-like noises) can be utilized as an information carrier with\npeculiar properties therefore it may be proper to call this topic Thermal Noise\nInformatics. Zero Power (Stealth) Communication, Thermal Noise Driven\nComputing, and Totally Secure Classical Communication are relevant examples. In\nthis paper, while we will briefly describe the first and the second subjects,\nwe shall focus on the third subject, the secure classical communication via\nwire. This way of secure telecommunication utilizes the properties of\nJohnson(-like) noise and those of a simple Kirchhoff's loop. The communicator\nis unconditionally secure at the conceptual (circuit theoretical) level and\nthis property is (so far) unique in communication systems based on classical\nphysics. The communicator is superior to quantum alternatives in all known\naspects, except the need of using a wire. In the idealized system, the\neavesdropper can extract zero bit of information without getting uncovered. The\nscheme is naturally protected against the man-in-the-middle attack. The\ncommunication can take place also via currently used power lines or phone\n(wire) lines and it is not only a point-to-point communication like quantum\nchannels but network-ready. Tests have been carried out on a model-line with\nranges beyond the ranges of any known direct quantum communication channel and\nthey indicate unrivalled signal fidelity and security performance. This simple\ndevice has single-wire secure key generation/sharing rates of 0.1, 1, 10, and\n100 bit/second for copper wires with diameters/ranges of 21 mm / 2000 km, 7 mm\n/ 200 km, 2.3 mm / 20 km, and 0.7 mm / 2 km, respectively and it performs with\n0.02% raw-bit error rate (99.98 % fidelity).\n",

We investigate the\nproblem by means of lattice Boltzmann (LB) simulations and introduce an\n``effective no-slip plane'' at an intermediate position between peaks and\nvalleys of the surface. Our simulations show good agreement with analytical\nresults for sinusoidal boundaries, but can be extended to arbitrary geometries\nand experimentally obtained surface data. We find that the detected apparent\nslip is independent of the detailed boundary shape, but only given by the\ndistribution of surface heights. Further, we show that the slip diverges as the\namplitude of the roughness increases.\n",

From the molecular Hamiltonian, using and discussing the\nBorn-Oppenheimer approximation, we arrive to the Hartree and Hartree-Fock\nequations for the electronic problem. Special emphasis is placed in the most\nrelevant mathematical aspects of the theoretical derivation of the final\nequations, as well as in the results regarding the existence and uniqueness of\ntheir solutions. All Hartree-Fock versions with different spin restrictions are\nsystematically extracted from the general case, thus providing a unifying\nframework. Then, the discretization of the one-electron orbitals space is\nreviewed and the Roothaan-Hall formalism introduced. This leads to a exposition\nof the basic underlying concepts related to the construction and selection of\nGaussian basis sets, focusing in algorithmic efficiency issues. Finally, we\nclose the review with a section in which the most relevant modern developments\n(specially those related to the design of linear-scaling methods) are commented\nand linked to the issues discussed. The whole work is intentionally\nintroductory and rather self-contained, so that it may be useful for non\nexperts that aim to use quantum chemical methods in interdisciplinary\napplications. Moreover, much material that is found scattered in the literature\nhas been put together here to facilitate comprehension and to serve as a handy\nreference.\n",

        "abstract": "  We present here a review of the fundamental topics of Hartree-Fock theory in\nQuantum Chemistry. From the molecular Hamiltonian, using and discussing the\nBorn-Oppenheimer approximation, we arrive to the Hartree and Hartree-Fock\nequations for the electronic problem. Special emphasis is placed in the most\nrelevant mathematical aspects of the theoretical derivation of the final\nequations, as well as in the results regarding the existence and uniqueness of\ntheir solutions. All Hartree-Fock versions with different spin restrictions are\nsystematically extracted from the general case, thus providing a unifying\nframework. Then, the discretization of the one-electron orbitals space is\nreviewed and the Roothaan-Hall formalism introduced. This leads to a exposition\nof the basic underlying concepts related to the construction and selection of\nGaussian basis sets, focusing in algorithmic efficiency issues. Finally, we\nclose the review with a section in which the most relevant modern developments\n(specially those related to the design of linear-scaling methods) are commented\nand linked to the issues discussed. The whole work is intentionally\nintroductory and rather self-contained, so that it may be useful for non\nexperts that aim to use quantum chemical methods in interdisciplinary\napplications. Moreover, much material that is found scattered in the literature\nhas been put together here to facilitate comprehension and to serve as a handy\nreference.\n",

Existing studies\non this subject, however, have neglected the network character of the\ninteraction between university and industry. Here we use state-of-the-art\nnetwork theory methods to analyze this interplay in the so-called Framework\nProgramme--an initiative which sets out the priorities for the European Union's\nresearch and technological development. In particular we study in the 5th\nFramework Programme (FP5) the role played by companies and scientific\ninstitutions and how they contribute to enhance the relationship between\nresearch and industry. Our approach provides quantitative evidence that while\nfirms are size hierarchically organized, universities and research\norganizations keep the network from falling into pieces, paving the way for an\neffective knowledge transfer.\n",

        "abstract": "  For Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) systems, resource allocation\nbetween several users within a piconet and the coexistence of several piconets\nare very important points to take into consideration for the optimization of\nhigh data rate Ultra Wide Band (UWB) systems. To improve the performance of the\nMulti-Band OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex) solution proposed by\nthe Multi-Band OFDM Alliance (MBOA), the addition of a spreading component in\nthe frequency domain is a good solution since it makes resource allocation\neasier and also offers better robustness against channel frequency selectivity\nand narrowband interference. The Spread Spectrum - Multi-Carrier - Multiple\nAccess (SS-MC-MA) system proposed in this article offers not only the\nadvantages of Multi-Carrier - Coded Division Multiple Access (MC-CDMA) brought\nby frequency spreading, but also a more effective dynamic resource allocation\nin a multi-user and multi-piconet context. These improvements are obtained\nwithout increasing the complexity of the radio-frequency part compared to the\nclassical MBOA solution.\n",

The navigation efficiency can\nbe remarkably enhanced via a few routers. Some advanced strategies are also\ndesigned: For non-geographical scale-free networks, the targeted strategy with\na tiny fraction of routers can guarantee an efficient navigation with low and\nstable delivery time almost independent of network size. For geographical\nlocalized networks, the clustering strategy can simultaneously increase the\nefficiency and reduce the communication cost. The present mixing navigation\nmechanism is of significance especially for information organization of\nwireless sensor networks and distributed autonomous robotic systems.\n",

Previously used\nscattering and reaction cross section data are critically assessed and in some\ncases modified. To validate our model, we compare the densities in the bulk of\nthe discharge with experimental data and find good agreement, indicating that\nessential aspects of an oxygen discharge are captured.\n",

As an example, we analyze data on a\nstrong forward peaking of thermal proton yield in the Bi($\\gamma$,p)\nphotonuclear reaction. New analysis shows that the phase relaxation in\nhighly-excited heavy nuclei can be 8 orders of magnitude or even much longer\nthan the energy relaxation. We argue that thermalized non-equilibrated matter\nresembles a high temperature superconducting state in quantum many-body\nsystems. We briefly present results on the time-dependent correlation function\nof the many-particle density fluctuations for such a superconducting state. It\nshould be of interest to experimentally search for manifestations of\nthermalized non-equilibrated matter in many-body mesoscopic systems and\nnanostructures.\n",

        "abstract": "  Soil bulk density affects water storage, water and nutrient movement, and\nplant root activity in the soil profile. Its measurement is difficult in field\nconditions. Vibration-induced conductivity fluctuation was investigated to\nquantify soil bulk density with possible field applications in the future. The\nAC electrical conductivity of soil was measured using a pair of blade-like\nelectrodes while exposing the soil to periodic vibration. The blades were\npositioned longitudinally and transversally to the direction of the induced\nvibration to enable the calculation of a normalized index. The normalized index\nwas expected to provide data independent from the vibration strength and to\nreduce the effect of soil salinity and water content. The experiment was\nconducted on natural and salinized fine sand at two moisture conditions and\nfour bulk densities. The blade-shaped electrodes improved electrode-soil\ncontact compared to cylindrical electrodes, and thereby, reduced measurement\nnoise. Simulations on a simplified resistor lattice indicate that the\ntransversal effect increases as soil bulk density decreases. Measurement of dry\nsand showed a negative correlation between the normalized conductivity\nfluctuation and soil bulk density for both longitudinal and transversal\nsettings. The decrease in the transversal signal was smaller than expected. The\nwet natural and salinized soils performed very similarly as hypothesized, but\ntheir normalized VICOF response was not significant to bulk density changes.\n",

Some\ndistributions have been proposed to solve the problem, but unfortunately they\ndo not fit at the same time both ending tails. We show that many different data\nin rank laws, like in granular materials, codons, author impact in scientific\njournal, etc. are very well fitted by a beta-like function. Then we propose\nthat such universality is due to the fact that a system made from many\nsubsystems or choices, imply stretched exponential frequency-rank functions\nwhich qualitatively and quantitatively can be fitted with the proposed\nbeta-like function distribution in the limit of many random variables. We prove\nthis by transforming the problem into an algebraic one: finding the rank of\nsuccessive products of a given set of numbers.\n",

        "abstract": "  Mixed action lattice calculations allow for an additive lattice spacing\ndependent mass renormalization of mesons composed of one sea and one valence\nquark, regardless of the type of fermion discretization methods used in the\nvalence and sea sectors. The value of the mass renormalization depends upon the\nlattice actions used. This mixed meson mass shift is an important lattice\nartifact to determine for mixed action calculations; because it modifies the\npion mass, it plays a central role in the low energy dynamics of all hadronic\ncorrelation functions. We determine the leading order, $\\mathcal{O}(a^2)$, and\nnext to leading order, $\\mathcal{O}(a^2 m_\\pi^2)$, additive mass shift of\n\\textit{valence-sea} mesons for a mixed lattice action with domain-wall valence\nfermions and rooted staggered sea fermions, relevant to the majority of current\nlarge scale mixed action lattice efforts. We find that on the asqtad improved\ncoarse MILC lattices, this additive mass shift is well parameterized in lattice\nunits by $\\Delta(am)^2 = 0.034(2) -0.06(2) (a m_\\pi)^2$, which in physical\nunits, using $a=0.125$ fm, corresponds to $\\Delta(m)^2 = (291\\pm 8\n\\textrm{MeV})^2 -0.06(2) m_\\pi^2$. In terms of the mixed action effective field\ntheory parameters, the corresponding mass shift is given by $a^2\n\\Delta_\\mathrm{Mix} = (316 \\pm 4 \\textrm{MeV})^2$ at leading order plus\nnext-to-leading order corrections including the necessary chiral logarithms for\nthis mixed action calculation, determined in this work. Within the precision of\nour calculation, one can not distinguish between the full next-to-leading order\neffective field theory analysis of this additive mixed meson mass shift and the\nparameterization given above.\n",

In particular we can tune the strength of the QCD anomaly and thus\nstudy its effects on the chiral phase transition. Our study confirms the widely\naccepted view point that the chiral phase transition is first order in the\nabsence of the anomaly. Turning on the anomaly weakens the transition and turns\nit second order at a critical anomaly strength. The anomaly strength at the\ntricritical point is characterized using $r = (M_{\\eta'}-M_{\\pi})/\\rho_{\\eta'}$\nwhere $M_{\\eta'}, M_{\\pi}$ are the screening masses of the anomalous and\nregular pions and $\\rho_{\\eta'}$ is the mass-scale that governs the low energy\nfluctuations of the anomalous symmetry. We estimate that $r \\sim 7 $ in our\nmodel. This suggests that a strong anomaly at the two-flavor QCD chiral phase\ntransition is necessary to wash out the first order transition.\n",

        "abstract": "  A spectral method is described for solving coupled elliptic problems on an\ninterior and an exterior domain. The method is formulated and tested on the\ntwo-dimensional interior Poisson and exterior Laplace problems, whose solutions\nand their normal derivatives are required to be continuous across the\ninterface. A complete basis of homogeneous solutions for the interior and\nexterior regions, corresponding to all possible Dirichlet boundary values at\nthe interface, are calculated in a preprocessing step. This basis is used to\nconstruct the influence matrix which serves to transform the coupled boundary\nconditions into conditions on the interior problem. Chebyshev approximations\nare used to represent both the interior solutions and the boundary values. A\nstandard Chebyshev spectral method is used to calculate the interior solutions.\nThe exterior harmonic solutions are calculated as the convolution of the\nfree-space Green's function with a surface density; this surface density is\nitself the solution to an integral equation which has an analytic solution when\nthe boundary values are given as a Chebyshev expansion. Properties of Chebyshev\napproximations insure that the basis of exterior harmonic functions represents\nthe external near-boundary solutions uniformly. The method is tested by\ncalculating the electrostatic potential resulting from charge distributions in\na rectangle. The resulting influence matrix is well-conditioned and solutions\nconverge exponentially as the resolution is increased. The generalization of\nthis approach to three-dimensional problems is discussed, in particular the\nmagnetohydrodynamic equations in a finite cylindrical domain surrounded by a\nvacuum.\n",

The main tools used are a three-dimensional particle tracking system\n(3D-PTV) allowing to measure and follow in a Lagrangian manner the field of\nvelocity derivatives and direct numerical simulations (DNS). The comparison of\nflow properties in the turbulent (A), intermediate (B) and non-turbulent (C)\nregions in the proximity of the interface allows for direct observation of the\nkey physical processes underlying the entrainment phenomenon. The differences\nbetween small scale strain and enstrophy are striking and point to the definite\nscenario of turbulent entrainment via the viscous forces originating in strain.\n",

It is based on spatio-temporal modulation of the surface plasmon\npolariton (SPP) fields at the thick edge of a nanowedge. The SPP wavepackets\npropagating toward the sharp edge of this nanowedge are compressed and\nadiabatically concentrated at a nanofocus, forming an ultrashort pulse of local\nfields. The one-dimensional spatial profile and temporal waveform of this pulse\nare completely coherently controlled.\n",

Second, the non-physical discontinuous boundary conditions at the\ncylindrical corners are smoothed using a polynomial approximation to a steep\nexponential profile. Third, the nonlinear term is evaluated in such a way as to\neliminate singularities. The resulting pseudo-spectral code is tested using\nexact polynomial solutions and the spectral convergence of the coefficients is\ndemonstrated. Our solutions are shown to agree with exact polynomial solutions\nand with previous axisymmetric calculations of vortex breakdown and of\nnonaxisymmetric calculations of onset of helical spirals. Parallelization by\nazimuthal wavenumber is shown to be highly effective.\n",

        "abstract": "  The lifetime of the asymmetric fundamental stretching 2218 cm$^{-1}$\nvibration of the anesthetic gas nitrous oxide (N$_2$O) dissolved in octanol and\nolive oil is reported. These solvents are model systems commonly used to assess\nanesthetic potency. Picosecond time-scale molecular dynamics simulations have\nsuggested that protein dynamics or membrane dynamics play a role in the\nmolecular mechanism of anesthetic action. Ultrafast infrared spectroscopy with\n100 fs time resolution is an ideal tool to probe dynamics of anesthetic\nmolecules on such timescales. Pump-probe studies at the peak of the vibrational\nband yield a lifetime of $55 \\pm 1$ ps in olive oil and $52 \\pm 1 ps$ in\noctanol. The similarity of lifetimes suggests that energy relaxation of the\nanesthetic is determined primarily by the hydrophobic nature of the\nenvironment, consistent with models of anesthetic action. The results show that\nnitrous oxide is a good model system for probing anesthetic-solvent\ninteractions using nonlinear infrared spectroscopy.\n",

Unlike most deformed microcavities, the lasing threshold\nvaries non-monotonically with the major-to-minor-axis ratio of the stadium.\nUnder spatially uniform optical pumping, the first lasing mode corresponds to a\nhigh-quality scar mode consisting of several unstable periodic orbits. By\ntuning the shape of GaAs stadium, we are able to minimize the lasing threshold.\nThis work demonstrates the possibility of controlling chaotic microcavity\nlaser.\n",

The interference of partial waves\npropagating along the constituent orbits results in local maxima of quality\nfactor at certain frequencies.

For the standard minimal Lagrangians\n(asymmetrical under the complex conjugated fields) it is shown that the charge\nconjugation (C-) symmetry conditions for the Hamiltonian and the charge\noperator lead to the identities for the operator products allowing one to\nreplace the negative frequency operator products to the positive frequency\nones. At the same time the operators in observables become normal ordered and\nthe zero-point energy does not appear. Only the symmetrized under the field\noperators Lagrangians lead to the zero-point energy. The confrontation by the\nexperiments of the such C-symmetric quantization of fields and the solution\nsome of the vacuum energy problems are discussed.\n",

The current\nprevalent 'canalization' hypothesis for the formation of veins claims that the\ntransport of the hormone auxin out of the leaves triggers cell differentiation\nto form veins. Although there is evidence that auxin plays a fundamental role\nin vein formation, the simple canalization mechanism may not be enough to\nexplain some features observed in the vascular system of leaves, in particular,\nthe abundance of vein loops. We present a model based on the existence of\nmechanical instabilities that leads very naturally to hierarchical patterns\nwith a large number of closed loops. When applied to the structure of high\norder veins, the numerical results show the same qualitative features as actual\nvenation patterns and, furthermore, have the same statistical properties. We\nargue that the agreement between actual and simulated patterns provides strong\nevidence for the role of mechanical effects on venation development.\n",

Experimental results in p+p collisions when compared to NLO pQCD\ncalculations show that at high transverse momentum (pT) the produced\nprotons+anti-protons are dominantly from gluon jets and charged pions have\nsubstantial contribution from quark jets. If such a scenario is applied to\nheavy-ion collisions at RHIC, one would expect the difference in quark and\ngluon energy loss to have an effect on measured observables, such as high pT\npbar(p)/pi ratios and the nuclear modification factor for various particles\nspecies.

However, this type of field and particle configuration has not been\ndirectly observed in space plasmas. Here we report the identification of a pair\nof nulls, the null-null line that connects them, and associated fans and spines\nin the magnetotail of Earth using data from the four Cluster spacecraft. With\ndi and de designating the ion and electron inertial lengths, respectively, the\nseparation between the nulls is found to be ~0.7di and an associated\noscillation is identified as a lower hybrid wave with wavelength ~ de. This in\nsitu evidence of the full 3D reconnection geometry and associated dynamics\nprovides an important step toward to establishing an observational framework of\n3D reconnection.\n",

All the samples\nwere aligned with the proton beam axis inside and outside the demountable 92-cm\nthick Pb target of 15-cm diameter assembled of 23 4-cm thick discs. The samples\nwere placed on 12 target disks to reproduce the long axis distribution of\nprotons and neutrons. In June 2006, the target was exposed for 18 hours to a\n800-MeV proton beam extracted from the ITEP U-10 accelerator. The proton\nfluence and the proton beam shape were determined using the 27Al(p,x)7Be\nmonitor reaction. The reaction rates were determined by the direct\ngamma-spectrometry techniques. In total, 1196 gamma-spectra have been measured,\nand about 1500 reaction rates determined. The measured reaction rates were\nsimulated by the MCNPX code using the following databases: ENDF/B6 for neutrons\nbelow 20 MeV, MENDL2 for 20-100 MeV neutrons, and MENDL2P for proton cross\nsections up to 200 MeV. An acceptable agreement of simulations with\nexperimental data has been found.\n",

Final states comprising two protons, one\npositively charged kaon and one negatively charged pion have been identified\nwith the ANKE spectrometer. Such configurations are sensitive to the production\nof the ground state Lambda and Sigma0 hyperons as well as the Sigma0(1385) and\nLambda(1405) resonances. Applying invariant- and missing-mass techniques, the\ntwo overlapping excited states could be well separated, though with limited\nstatistics. The shape and position of the Lambda(1405) distribution,\nreconstructed cleanly in the Sigma0 pion0 channel, are similar to those found\nfrom other decay modes and there is no obvious mass shift. This finding\nconstitutes a challenging test for models that predict Lambda(1405) to be a\ntwo-state resonance.\n",

In the\nderivation, a Non-Gibrat's law under the detailed balance is adopted together\nwith following two approximations. Firstly, the probability density function of\nprofits growth rate is described as a tent-shaped exponential function.\nSecondly, the value of the origin of the growth rate distribution divided into\nbins is constant. The derivation is confirmed in the database consistently.\n  This static procedure is applied to a quasi-static system. We dynamically\ndescribe a quasi-static log-normal distribution in the middle scale region. In\nthe derivation, a Non-Gibrat's law under the detailed quasi-balance is adopted\ntogether with two approximations confirmed in the static system. The resultant\ndistribution is power-law with varying Pareto index in the large scale region\nand the quasi-static log-normal distribution in the middle scale region. In the\ndistribution, not only the change of Pareto index but also the change of the\nvariance of the log-normal distribution depends on the parameter of the\ndetailed quasi-balance. As a result, Pareto index and the variance of the\nlog-normal distribution are related to each other.\n",

        "abstract": "  A simple stochastic formulation of the multiple scattering representation\nsolution of the classical linear incoherent trapping problem is presented for a\nbroad audience. A clear connection with the alternative Holstein's solution\nansatz is emphasized by the (re)interpretation of the fundamental mode as the\none associated with a relaxed nonchanging spatial distribution of excitation.\nExpressions for overall relaxation parameters (ensemble emission yield and\nlifetime) as well as time-resolved (decay and spatial distribution) and\nsteady-state quantities (spectra and spatial distribution) are given with the\nfundamental mode contribution singled out. The multiple scattering\nrepresentation is advocated for final undergraduate and beginning graduate\nphysics instruction based on physical insight and computation feasibility. This\nwill be illustrated in the following instalment of this contribution.\n",

In this paper we construct two\nsimple analytical theories for the structural properties of PS fluids: a\nlow-temperature (LT) approximation, that can be seen as an extension to PSs of\nthe well-known solution of the Percus-Yevick (PY) equation for hard spheres,\nand a high-temperature (HT) approximation based on the exact asymptotic\nbehavior in the limit of infinite temperature. Monte Carlo simulations for a\nwide range of temperatures and densities are performed to assess the validity\nof both theories. It is found that, despite their simplicity, the HT and LT\napproximations exhibit a fair agreement with the simulation data within their\nrespective domains of applicability, so that they complement each other. A\ncomparison with numerical solutions of the PY and the hypernetted-chain\napproximations is also carried out, the latter showing a very good performance,\nexcept inside the core at low temperatures.\n",

In addition to some processes previously considered, we also\nexamine a model of local mass media influence in cultural dynamics. Two\nmechanisms of information feedback are investigated: (i) direct mass media\ninfluence, where local or global mass media act as an additional element in the\nnetwork of interactions of each agent, and (ii) indirect mass media influence,\nwhere global media acts as a filter of the influence of the existing network of\ninteractions of each agent. Our results generalize previous findings showing\nthat cultural diversity builds-up by increasing the strength of the mass media\ninfluence. We find that this occurs independently of the mechanisms of action\n(direct or indirect) of the mass media message. However, through an analysis of\nthe full range of parameters measuring cultural diversity, we establish that\nthe enhancement of cultural diversity produced by interaction with mass media\nonly occurs for strong enough mass media messages. In comparison with previous\nstudies a main different result is that weak mass media messages, in\ncombination with agent-agent interaction, are efficient in producing cultural\nhomogeneity. Moreover, the homogenizing effect of weak mass media messages are\nmore efficient for direct local mass media messages than for global mass media\nmessages or indirect global mass media influences.\n",

        "abstract": "  The monotonicity and stability of difference schemes for, in general,\nhyperbolic systems of conservation laws with source terms are studied. The\nbasic approach is to investigate the stability and monotonicity of a non-linear\nscheme in terms of its corresponding scheme in variations. Such an approach\nleads to application of the stability theory for linear equation systems to\nestablish stability of the corresponding non-linear scheme. The main\nmethodological innovation is the theorems establishing the notion that a\nnon-linear scheme is stable (and monotone) if the corresponding scheme in\nvariations is stable (and, respectively, monotone). Criteria are developed for\nmonotonicity and stability of difference schemes associated with the numerical\nanalysis of systems of partial differential equations. The theorem of\nFriedrichs (1954) is generalized to be applicable to variational schemes with\nnon-symmetric matrices. A new modification of the central Lax-Friedrichs (LxF)\nscheme is developed to be of the second order accuracy. A monotone piecewise\ncubic interpolation is used in the central schemes to give an accurate\napproximation for the model in question. The stability and monotonicity of the\nmodified scheme are investigated. Some versions of the modified scheme are\ntested on several conservation laws, and the scheme is found to be accurate and\nrobust. As applied to hyperbolic conservation laws with, in general, stiff\nsource terms, it is constructed a second order scheme based on\noperator-splitting techniques.\n",

The\nyield of direct photons can be determined based on the inclusive photon yield\nand the background from hadronic decays. We present a new analysis technique\napplied to PHENIX Run4 Au+Au dataset. It uses strict particle\nidentification(PID) in the Electromagnetic Calorimeter(EMCal) and a charged\nparticle veto to extract a clean photon signal. These photons are then tagged\nwith EMCal photon candidates with loose PID cuts, which can be reconstructed\nwith high efficiency, to determine the fraction of photons originating from\n$\\pi^{0}$ decays. Many systematic uncertainties and detector effects cancel in\nthis method.\n",

Counting arguments and insights from the phase-space\nSchmidt decomposition and in general from the framework of symplectic analysis,\naccompany our description of the standard form of pure n-mode Gaussian states.\nIn particular we clarify why only in pure states with n<=3 modes all the direct\ncorrelations between position and momentum operators can be set to zero by\nlocal unitary operations. For any n, the emerging minimal set of parametres\ncontains complete information about all forms of entanglement in the\ncorresponding states. An efficient state engineering scheme (able to encode\ndirect correlations between position and momentum operators as well) is\nproposed to produce entangled multimode Gaussian resources, its number of\noptical elements matching the minimal number of locally invariant degrees of\nfreedom of general pure n-mode Gaussian states. We demonstrate that so-called\n\"block-diagonal\" Gaussian states, without direct correlations between position\nand momentum, are systematically less entangled, on average, than arbitrary\npure Gaussian states.\n",

The unidirectionality of the\nincompressible flows conserves the stream-wise scalar gradient,\n$\\partial_x\\Theta$, allowing only the cross-stream components to be amplified\nby shearing effects. This amplification is relatively weak because an important\ncontributing factor, $\\partial_x\\Theta$, is conserved, effectively rendering a\nslow diffusion process. It is found that the decay of the scalar variance\n$<\\Theta^2>$ satisfies $d<\\Theta^2>/dt\\ge -C\\kappa^{1/3}$, where $C>0$ is a\nconstant, depending on the fluid velocity gradients and initial distribution of\n$\\Theta$, and $\\kappa$ is the molecular diffusivity. This result generalizes to\naxisymmetric flows on the plane and on the sphere having finite mean-square\nangular velocity gradients.\n",

We then prove the (theoretical) existence of a\nvariable metric $g_t$, depending on time and satisfying to a simplified\nEinstein equation, so that all free ordinary trajectories are geodesics. This\nis done by considering the classical Galileo-Newtonian space and time relation,\nby using generalized Newtonian principles and adding the approved physical new\nones (as covariance principle, Mach principle, the Einstein equivalence\nprinciple ...) in order to establish a new cosmological model of the dynamical\nUniverse as being $(U(t))_{t\\geq 0}=(B_e(O,t),g_t)_{t\\geq 0}$, where $B_e(O,t)$\nis the Euclidean ball of radius $t$ in $\\mathbb R^3$. The cosmological metric\n$g_t$ is totally determined, at time $t$, by the mass energy distribution\n$E_t(X)$ on $B_e(O,t)$. We study also the black holes phenomenon and we prove\nthat the total and global cosmological energy distribution $E_t(X)$ satisfies\nto the wave equation whose solutions are characterized by pseudo-frequencies\ndepending on time and related to the spectrum of the Dirichlet problem on the\nunit ball $B_e(O,1)$ for the Laplace-Beltrami operator -$\\Delta$. Our model is\nconsistent in the sense that all Newtonian and classical physical laws are\nvalid as particular cases in classical situations. Then, we show that all basic\nresults of Modern Physics are still valid without using the second postulate of\nspecial relativity nor the uncertainty principle.\n",

        "abstract": "  The paper offers a discrete thermodynamic model of lasers. Laser is an open\nsystem; its equilibrium is based on a balance of two thermodynamic forces, one\nrelated to the incoming pumping power and another to the emitted light. The\nbasic expression for such equilibrium is a logistic map, graphical solutions to\nwhich are pitchfork bifurcation diagrams. As pumping force increases, the\nrelative populations on the ground and lasing branches tend to zero and unity\ncorrespondingly. An interesting feature of this model is the line spectrum of\nthe up and down transitions between the branches beyond bifurcation point. Even\nin a simple case of 2-level laser with only 2 possible transition types (up and\ndown), the spectra look like sets of the line packets, starting well before the\npopulation inversion. This effect is an independent confirmation of the\nEinstein's prohibition on practical realization of 2-level laser. Multilevel\nlasers may be approached by employing the idea of thermodynamic activity for\nthe emitting atoms. Considering coefficient of thermodynamic activity of the\nlasing level atoms to be proportional to the ratio of life times on the upper\nand lasing (the 3d) levels, one can derive a new basic map for the multilevel\nlaser system. For a modest ratio only of 0.01, spontaneous transitions between\nlevels are pushed to the area beyond population inversion, opening a space for\nthe functioning of laser.\n",

Our study consists of two parts: the analysis of frequency-rank\ndistributions and the application of complex networks theory. The analysis of\nfrequency-rank distributions shows that the text sizes are enough to observe\nstatistical properties. The power-law character of these distributions (Zipf's\nlaw) holds in the region of rank variable r=20 - 3000 with an exponent\n$\\alpha\\simeq 1$. This substantiates the choice of the above texts to analyse\ntypical properties of the language complex network on their basis. Besides, an\napplicability of the Simon model to describe non-asymptotic properties of word\ndistributions is evaluated.\n  In describing language as a complex network, usually the words are associated\nwith nodes, whereas one may give different meanings to the network links. This\nresults in different network representations. In the second part of the paper,\nwe give different representations of the language network and perform\ncomparative analysis of their characteristics. Our results demonstrate that the\nlanguage network of Ukrainian is a strongly correlated scale-free small world.\nEmpirical data obtained may be useful for theoretical description of language\nevolution.\n",

The field is produced\nby a permanent magnet enclosed in an inner sphere, which can rotate at a\nseparate rate, producing a spherical Couette flow. The flow properties are\ninvestigated by measuring electric potentials on the outer sphere, the induced\nmagnetic field in the laboratory frame, and velocity profiles inside the liquid\nsodium using ultrasonic Doppler velocimetry. The present article focuses on the\ntime-averaged axisymmetric part of the flow. The Doppler profiles show that the\nangular velocity of the fluid is relatively uniform in most of the fluid shell,\nbut rises near the inner sphere, revealing the presence of a magnetic wind, and\ngently drops towards the outer sphere. The transition from a magnetostrophic\nflow near the inner sphere to a geostrophic flow near the outer sphere is\ncontrolled by the local Elsasser number. For Rossby numbers up to order 1, the\nobserved velocity profiles all show a similar shape. Numerical simulations in\nthe linear regime are computed, and synthetic velocity profiles are compared\nwith the measured ones. In the geostrophic region, a torque-balance model\nprovides very good predictions. We find that the induced magnetic field varies\nin a consistent fashion, and displays a peculiar peak in the counter-rotating\nregime. This happens when the fluid rotation rate is almost equal and opposite\nto the outer sphere rotation rate. The fluid is then almost at rest in the\nlaboratory frame, and the Proudman-Taylor constraint vanishes, enabling a\nstrong meridional flow. We suggest that dynamo action might be favored in such\na situation.\n",

For the method\napprobation, there was synthesized the device in which the wideband filters are\nused for the channel separation. As it was expected, the device effectively\nseparates 50 fs pulse channels with 1.31 and 1.55 microns wavelengths.

The hydrogen has to be kept extremely\npure and at a stable pressure. A Circulating Hydrogen Ultrahigh Purification\nSystem was designed at the Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute (PNPI) to\ncontinuously clean the hydrogen from impurities. The system is based on an\nadsorption cryopump to stimulate the hydrogen flow and on a cold adsorbent for\nthe hydrogen cleaning. It was installed at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in\n2004 and performed reliably during three experiment runs. During several months\nlong operating periods the system maintained the hydrogen purity in the\ndetector on the level of 20 ppb for moisture, which is the main contaminant,\nand of better than 7 ppb and 5 ppb for nitrogen and oxygen, respectively. The\npressure inside the TPC was stabilized to within 0.024% of 10 bar at a hydrogen\nflow rate of 3 standard liters per minute.\n",

        "abstract": "  Historically, the thermodynamic behavior of gasses was described first and\nthe derived equations were adapted to solids. It is suggested that the current\nthermodynamic description of solid phase is still incomplete because the\nisothermal work done on or by the system is not counted in the internal energy.\nIt is also suggested that the isobaric work should not be deducted from the\ninternal energy because the system does not do work when it expands. Further\nmore it is suggested that Joule postulate regarding the mechanical equivalency\nof heat -the first law of thermodynamics- is not universal and not applicable\nto elastic solids. The equations for the proposed thermodynamic description of\nsolids are derived and tested by calculating the internal energies of the\nsystem using the equation of state of MgO. The agreement with theory is good.\n",

The model is pretending to describe various planar systems\nof strongly correlated electrons such as high-Tc superconductivity in the\noverdoped regime and exotic materials possessing excitations with\nfractionalized quantum numbers. The complicated phase structure of the model is\nstudied thoroughly using numerical tools and analytical arguments. In the\nthree-dimensional space of coupling parameters we identify the Fermi liquid,\nthe spin gap, the superconductor and the strange metallic phases. The behavior\nof three kinds of topological defects -- holon and spinon vortices and\nmonopoles - is explored in various phases. We also observe a new effect, the\nstrong enhancement of the phase transition strength reflected in a lower order\nof the transition: at sufficiently strong gauge coupling the two second order\nphase transitions -- corresponding to spinon-pair and holon condensation lines\n- join partially in the phase diagram and become a first order phase transition\nin that region. The last observation may have an analogue in Quantum\nChromodynamics at non-zero temperature and finite baryon density. We argue that\nat sufficiently large baryon density the finite-temperature transition between\nthe (3-flavor paired) color superconducting phase and the quark-gluon plasma\nphases should be much stronger compared with the transition between 2-flavor\npaired and 3-flavor paired superconducting phases.\n",

The neutronic of such target is of course of prime\nimportance when considering its final destination as an intense neutron source.\nThis is the motivation to characterize the inside neutron flux of the target in\noperation. A complex detector, made of 8 micro fission-chambers, has been built\nand installed in the core of the target, few tens of centimeters from the\nproton/Pb-Bi interaction zone. This detector is designed to measure the\nabsolute neutron flux inside the target, to give its spatial distribution and\nto correlate its temporal variations with the beam intensity. Moreover,\nintegral information on the neutron energy distribution as a function of the\nposition along the beam axis could be extracted, giving integral constraints on\nthe neutron production models implemented in transport codes such as MCNPX.\n",

        "abstract": "  We describe a general framework for avoiding spurious eigenvalues --\nunphysical unstable eigenvalues that often occur in hydrodynamic stability\nproblems. In two example problems, we show that when system stability is\nanalyzed numerically using {\\em descriptor} notation, spurious eigenvalues are\neliminated. Descriptor notation is a generalized eigenvalue formulation for\ndifferential-algebraic equations that explicitly retains algebraic constraints.\nWe propose that spurious eigenvalues are likely to occur when algebraic\nconstraints are used to analytically reduce the number of independent variables\nin a differential-algebraic system of equations before the system is\napproximated numerically. In contrast, the simple and easily generalizable\ndescriptor framework simultaneously solves the differential equations and\nalgebraic constraints and is well-suited to stability analysis in these\nsystems.\n",

This solution gives an excellent parameter-free fit to\nthe recent supernova and gamma-ray burst data without the need for `dark\nenergy' or `dark matter'. The data and theory together imply an older age for\nthe universe of some 14.7Gyrs. Various problems such as fine tuning, the event\nhorizon problem etc are now resolved. A brief review discusses the origin of\nthe 3-space dynamics and how that dynamics explained the bore hole anomaly,\nspiral galaxy flat rotation speeds, the masses of black holes in spherical\ngalaxies, gravitational light bending and lensing, all without invoking `dark\nmatter' or `dark energy'. These developments imply that a new understanding of\nthe universe is now available.\n",

The numerical and the analytical results show excellent\nagreement, indicating that a temperature gradient orthogonal to the plates can\ninduce a significant force in parallel direction. This force is only slightly\nreduced when a Knudsen number of one is considered. In the future, the\ndiscovered effect may be exploited for the conversion of thermal into\nmechanical energy in nanomachines.\n",

We define an ensemble of hierarchically nested\nrandom graphs, which we use to validate the method.

While the orbital products of\na complete basis are linearly dependent, the HF ground state energy can only be\nobtained via a basis set xOEP scheme in the special case that all products of\noccupied and unoccupied orbitals emerging from the employed orbital basis set\nare linearly independent from each other. In this case, however, exchange\npotentials leading to the HF ground state energy exhibit unphysical\noscillations and do not represent a Kohn-Sham (KS) exchange potential. These\nfindings solve the seemingly paradoxical results of Staroverov, Scuseria and\nDavidson that certain finite basis set xOEP calculations lead to the HF ground\nstate energy despite the fact that within a real space (or complete basis)\nrepresentation the xOEP ground state energy is always higher than the HF\nenergy. Moreover, whether or not the occupied and unoccupied orbital products\nare linearly independent, it is shown that basis set xOEP methods only\nrepresent exact exchange-only (EXX) KS methods, i.e., proper density-functional\nmethods, if the orbital basis set and the auxiliary basis set representing the\nexchange potential are balanced to each other, i.e., if the orbital basis is\ncomprehensive enough for a given auxiliary basis. Otherwise xOEP methods do not\nrepresent EXX KS methods and yield unphysical exchange potentials.\n",

We apply it to two experimentally realized\nschemes, back-action cooling via a detuned cavity and cold-damping\nquantum-feedback cooling, and we determine the ultimate quantum limits of both\nschemes for the full parameter range of a stable cavity. While both allow to\nreach the oscillator's quantum ground state, we find that back-action cooling\nis more efficient in the good cavity limit, i.e. when the cavity bandwidth is\nsmaller than the mechanical frequency, while cold damping is more suitable for\nthe bad cavity limit. The results of previous treatments are recovered as\nlimiting cases of specific parameter regimes.\n",

        "abstract": "  Using in-medium hadron properties according to the Brown-Rho scaling due to\nthe chiral symmetry restoration at high densities and considering naturalness\nof the coupling constants, we have newly constructed several relativistic\nmean-field Lagrangians with chiral limits. The model parameters are adjusted\nsuch that the symmetric part of the resulting equation of state at supra-normal\ndensities is consistent with that required by the collective flow data from\nhigh energy heavy-ion reactions, while the resulting density dependence of the\nsymmetry energy at sub-saturation densities agrees with that extracted from the\nrecent isospin diffusion data from intermediate energy heavy-ion reactions. The\nresulting equations of state have the special feature of being soft at\nintermediate densities but stiff at high densities naturally. With these\nconstrained equations of state, it is found that the radius of a 1.4$M_\\odot$\ncanonical neutron star is in the range of 11.9 km$\\leq$R$\\leq$13.1 km, and the\nmaximum neutron star mass is around 2.0$M_\\odot$ close to the recent\nobservations.\n",

Items and concepts are represented by vectors in Fock space and\nmembership weights of items are modeled by quantum probabilities. We apply this\ntheory to model the disjunction of concepts and show that the predictions of\nour theory for the membership weights of items regarding the disjunction of\nconcepts match with great accuracy the complete set of results of an experiment\nconducted by Hampton (1988b). It are the quantum effects of interference and\nsuperposition of that are at the origin of the effects of overextension and\nunderextension observed by Hampton as deviations from a classical use of the\ndisjunction. It is essential for the perfect matches we obtain between the\npredictions of the quantum field model and Hampton's experimental data that\nitems can be in superpositions of `different numbers states' which proves that\nthe genuine structure of quantum field theory is needed to match predictions\nwith experimental data.\n",

        "abstract": "  Coulomb excitation of the exotic neutron-rich nucleus $^{26}$Ne on a\n$^{nat}$Pb target was measured at 58 A.MeV in order to search for low-lying E1\nstrength above the neutron emission threshold. Data were also taken on an\n$^{nat}$Al target to estimate the nuclear contribution. The radioactive beam\nwas produced by fragmentation of a 95 A.MeV $^{40}$Ar beam delivered by the\nRIKEN Research Facility. The set-up included a NaI gamma-ray array, a charged\nfragment hodoscope and a neutron wall. Using the invariant mass method in the\n$^{25}$Ne+n channel, we observe a sizable amount of E1 strength between 6 and\n10 MeV. The reconstructed $^{26}$Ne angular distribution confirms its E1\nnature. A reduced dipole transition probability of B(E1)=0.49$\\pm$0.16\n$e^2fm^2$ is deduced. For the first time, the decay pattern of low-lying\nstrength in a neutron-rich nucleus is obtained. The results are discussed in\nterms of a pygmy resonance centered around 9 MeV.\n",

        "abstract": "  We carry out the non-perturbative renormalization of the chromo-magnetic\noperator in Heavy Quark Effective Theory. At order 1/m of the expansion, the\noperator is responsible for the mass splitting between the pseudoscalar and\nvector B mesons. We obtain its two-loop anomalous dimension in a Schr\"odinger\nfunctional scheme by successive one-loop conversions to the lattice MS scheme\nand the MS-bar scheme. We then compute the scale evolution of the operator\nnon-perturbatively in the N_f=0 theory between $\\mu \\approx 0.3$ GeV and $\\mu\n\\approx 100$ GeV, where contact is made with perturbation theory. The overall\nrenormalization factor that converts the bare lattice operator to its\nrenormalization group invariant form is given for the Wilson gauge action and\ntwo standard discretizations of the heavy-quark action. As an application, we\nfind that this factor brings the previous quenched predictions of the B* - B\nmass splitting closer to the experimental value than found with a perturbative\nrenormalization. The same renormalization factor is applicable to the\nspin-dependent potentials of Eichten and Feinberg.\n",

        "abstract": "  The prediction of the three-dimensional native structure of proteins from the\nknowledge of their amino acid sequence, known as the protein folding problem,\nis one of the most important yet unsolved issues of modern science. Since the\nconformational behaviour of flexible molecules is nothing more than a complex\nphysical problem, increasingly more physicists are moving into the study of\nprotein systems, bringing with them powerful mathematical and computational\ntools, as well as the sharp intuition and deep images inherent to the physics\ndiscipline. This work attempts to facilitate the first steps of such a\ntransition. In order to achieve this goal, we provide an exhaustive account of\nthe reasons underlying the protein folding problem enormous relevance and\nsummarize the present-day status of the methods aimed to solving it. We also\nprovide an introduction to the particular structure of these biological\nheteropolymers, and we physically define the problem stating the assumptions\nbehind this (commonly implicit) definition. Finally, we review the 'special\nflavor' of statistical mechanics that is typically used to study the\nastronomically large phase spaces of macromolecules. Throughout the whole work,\nmuch material that is found scattered in the literature has been put together\nhere to improve comprehension and to serve as a handy reference.\n",

But this is a special case of a larger set of\nreaction-free trajectories that in general are curved paths through space, i.e.\nin 2+1 D. This note catalogs the full family of reaction-free trajectories,\ngiving a geometrical interpretation by which means the curved path possibility\nis easily related to the better known case of hyperbolic motion in 1+1 D.\nMotivated by the geometry, it is shown how the catalog of motions can be\nnaturally extended to include the possibility of lossless reaction-free closed\nspatial orbits that turn out to be classical pair creation and destruction\nevents. The extended theory can accommodate a vacuum plenum of classical\ncurrent that could be regarded as a classical version of the Fermionic ZPF of\nQFT, reminiscent of the relationship between the Electromagnetic ZPF and the\nclassical imitation that characterizes `Stochastic Electrodynamics'.\n",

The GAS consists of an\noptical pulse similar to the optical gap soliton, dressed by an accompanying\nphonon pulse. Close to the speed of sound, the phonon component is large. In\nsubsonic (supersonic) solitons, the phonon pulse is a positive (negative)\ndensity variation. Coupling to the acoustic field damps the solitons'\noscillatory instability, and gives rise to a distinct instability for\nsupersonic solitons, which may make the GAS decelerate and change direction,\nultimately making the soliton subsonic.\n",

        "abstract": "  Hall drift, i. e., transport of magnetic flux by the moving electrons giving\nrise to the electrical current, may be the dominant effect causing the\nevolution of the magnetic field in the solid crust of neutron stars. It is a\nnonlinear process that, despite a number of efforts, is still not fully\nunderstood. We use the Hall induction equation in axial symmetry to obtain some\ngeneral properties of nonevolving fields, as well as analyzing the evolution of\npurely toroidal fields, their poloidal perturbations, and current-free, purely\npoloidal fields. We also analyze energy conservation in Hall instabilities and\nwrite down a variational principle for Hall equilibria. We show that the\nevolution of any toroidal magnetic field can be described by Burgers' equation,\nas previously found in plane-parallel geometry. It leads to sharp current\nsheets that dissipate on the Hall time scale, yielding a stationary field\nconfiguration that depends on a single, suitably defined coordinate. This\nfield, however, is unstable to poloidal perturbations, which grow as their\nfield lines are stretched by the background electron flow, as in instabilities\nearlier found numerically. On the other hand, current-free poloidal\nconfigurations are stable and could represent a long-lived crustal field\nsupported by currents in the fluid stellar core.\n",

The\nexplicit error due to the non-commutivity of the updating operators when\nnumerically integrating Hamilton's equations can be derived using the\nBaker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. This error is manifest in the conservation of\na ``shadow'' Hamiltonian that lies close to the desired Hamiltonian. The fixed\npoint distribution of inexact Hybrid algorithms may then be derived taking into\naccount that the fixed point of the momentum heatbath and that of the molecular\ndynamics do not coincide exactly. We perform this derivation for various\ninexact algorithms used for lattice QCD calculations.\n",

        "abstract": "  Solar neutrino fluxes depend both on astrophysical and on nuclear physics\ninputs, namely on the cross sections of the reactions responsible for neutrino\nproduction inside the Solar core. While the flux of solar 8B neutrinos has been\nrecently measured at Superkamiokande with a 3.5% uncertainty and a precise\nmeasurement of 7Be neutrino flux is foreseen in the next future, the predicted\nfluxes are still affected by larger errors. The largest nuclear physics\nuncertainty to determine the fluxes of 8B and 7Be neutrinos comes from the\n3He(alpha,gamma)7Be reaction. The uncertainty on its S-factor is due to an\naverage discrepancy in results obtained using two different experimental\napproaches: the detection of the delayed gamma rays from 7Be decay and the\nmeasurement of the prompt gamma emission. Here we report on a new high\nprecision experiment performed with both techniques at the same time. Thanks to\nthe low background conditions of the Gran Sasso LUNA accelerator facility, the\ncross section has been measured at Ecm = 170, 106 and 93 keV, the latter being\nthe lowest interaction energy ever reached.\n  The S-factors from the two methods do not show any discrepancy within the\nexperimental errors. An extrapolated S(0)= 0.560+/-0.017 keV barn is obtained.\nMoreover, branching ratios between the two prompt gamma-transitions have been\nmeasured with 5-8% accuracy.\n",

If this is\nthe case then the speed of light, in fact any speed, must decrease inversely\nproportional to this age. The immediate consequence is that energy is not\nconserved: the hypothesis that time is a homogeneous property implies\nconservation of energy (the theorem of Noether). Nonconservation of energy\nfollows from the condition that any time interval is proportional to the\ncosmological time, and therefore time can not be homogeneous. From the\nuncertainty principle, taking the constant of Planck as a real constant, time\nindependent, it follows that any energy in the Universe decreases linearly with\ntime. We then prove that Schroedinger equation does not change, except for the\npotential energy term. The future of the Universe gives for the wave functions\na long sinusoidal spatial solution, so that everything becomes unlocalized. The\nrelativistic absolute interval remains the same, even with a changing speed of\nlight, and the Universe turns out to be nonexpanding. A Mass-Boom effect is\nconfirmed.\n",

For any choice of the lattice derivative, the theories can be made\nmanifestly supersymmetric by adding appropriate improvement terms corresponding\nto discretizations of surface integrals. In one dimension, our simulations show\nthat a model with the Wilson derivative and the Stratonovitch prescription for\nthis discretization leads to far better results at finite lattice spacing than\nother models with Wilson fermions considered in the literature. In particular,\nwe check that fermionic and bosonic masses coincide and the unbroken Ward\nidentities are fulfilled to high accuracy. Equally good results for the\neffective masses can be obtained in a model with the SLAC derivative (even\nwithout improvement terms).\n  In two dimensions we introduce a non-standard Wilson term in such a way that\nthe discretization errors of the kinetic terms are only of order O(a^2). Masses\nextracted from the corresponding manifestly supersymmetric model prove to\napproach their continuum values much quicker than those from a model containing\nthe standard Wilson term. Again, a comparable enhancement can be achieved in a\ntheory using the SLAC derivative.\n",

Although\nfluid spreads in all directions (velocity vector has three components) the\nwhole picture of motion is relatively simple: trajectory of one fluid particle\nfrom plane x=const completely determines motion of the whole plane. Basing on\nthe symmetry analysis of differential equations we propose generalization of\nthis solution allowing movements in different directions of fluid particles\nbelonging to plane x=const. At that, all functions but an angle determining the\ndirection of particle's motion depend on t and x only, whereas the angle\ndepends on all coordinates. In this solution the whole picture of motion\nsuperposes from identical trajectories placed under different angles in 3D\nspace. Orientations of the trajectories are restricted by a finite relation\npossessing functional arbitrariness. The solution describes three-dimensional\nnonlinear processes and singularities in infinitely conducting plasma, gas or\nincompressible liquid.\n",

        "abstract": "  The control of open quantum systems has a fundamental relevance for fields\nranging from quantum information processing to nanotechnology. Typically, the\nsystem whose coherent dynamics one wants to manipulate, interacts with an\nenvironment that smoothly degrades its quantum dynamics. Thus, a precise\nunderstanding of the inner mechanisms of this process, called \"decoherence\", is\ncritical to develop strategies to control the quantum dynamics. In this thesis\nwe solved the generalized Liouville-von Neumann quantum master equation to\nobtain the dynamics of many-spin systems interacting with a spin bath. We also\nsolve the spin dynamics within the Keldysh formalism. Both methods lead to\nidentical solutions and together gave us the possibility to obtain numerous\nphysical predictions that contrast well with Nuclear Magnetic Resonance\nexperiments. We applied these tools for molecular characterizations,\ndevelopment of new numerical methodologies and the control of quantum dynamics\nin experimental implementations. But, more important, these results contributed\nto fundamental physical interpretations of how quantum dynamics behaves in open\nsystems. In particular, we found a manifestation of an environmentally induced\nquantum dynamical phase transition.\n",

The detector, named as ENSTAR detector, consists of 122\npieces of plastic scintillator of various shapes and sizes, which are arranged\nin a cylindrical geometry to provide particle identification, energy loss and\ncoarse position information for these particles. A solid angle coverage of\n$\\sim$95% of total 4$\\pi$ is obtained in the present design of the detector.\nMonte Carlo phase space calculations performed to simulate the formation and\ndecay of $\\eta$-mesic nuclei suggest that its decay particles, the protons and\npions are emitted with an opening angle of 150$^\\circ \\pm 20^\\circ$, and with\nenergies in the range of 25 to 300 MeV and 225 to 450 MeV respectively. The\ndetailed GEANT simulations show that $\\sim$ 80 % of the decay particles\n(protons and pions) can be detected within ENSTAR. Several test measurements\nusing alpha source, cosmic-ray muons etc. have been carried out to study the\nresponse of ENSTAR scintillator pieces. The in-beam tests of fully assembled\ndetector with proton beam of momentum 870 MeV/c from the Cooler synchrotron\nCOSY have been performed. The test results show that the scintillator fiber\ndesign chosen for the detector has performed satisfactorily well. The present\narticle describes the detector design, simulation studies, construction details\nand test results.\n",

Their applications range from quantum electro-dynamics to\nsensors and filtering devices for optical telecommunication systems, where they\nare likely to become an essential building block. The integration of nonlinear\nand electro-optical properties in the resonators represents a very stimulating\nchallenge, as it would incorporate new and more advanced functionality. Lithium\nniobate is an excellent candidate material, being an established choice for\nelectro-optic and nonlinear optical applications. Here we report on the first\nrealization of optical microring resonators in submicrometric thin films of\nlithium niobate. The high index contrast films are produced by an improved\ncrystal ion slicing and bonding technique using benzocyclobutene. The rings\nhave radius R=100 um and their transmission spectrum has been tuned using the\nelectro-optic effect. These results open new perspectives for the use of\nlithium niobate in chip-scale integrated optical devices and nonlinear optical\nmicrocavities.\n",

The paper focuses on (gamma,alpha), (gamma,p), and\n(gamma,n) reactions which define the corresponding p-process path. The relation\nbetween stellar reaction rates and laboratory cross sections is analyzed for\nphoton-induced reactions and their inverse capture reactions to evaluate\nvarious experimental approaches. An improved version S_C(E) of the\nastrophysical S-factor is suggested which is based on the Coulomb wave\nfunctions. S_C(E) avoids the apparent energy dependence which is otherwise\nobtained for capture reactions on heavy nuclei. It is found that a special type\nof synchrotron radiation available at SPring-8 that mimics stellar blackbody\nradiation at billions of Kelvin is a promising tool for future experiments. By\nusing the blackbody synchrotron radiation, sufficient event rates for\n(gamma,alpha) and (gamma,p) reactions in the p-process path can be expected.\nThese experiments will provide data to improve the nuclear parameters involved\nin the statistical model and thus reduce the uncertainties of nucleosynthesis\ncalculations.\n",

Working in regimes characterized by moderate\nBurger numbers, i.e. $Bu = 1/\\epsilon^2 < 1$ or $Bu \\ge 1$, our results\nindicate profound change in the character of vortical and wave mode\ninteractions with respect to $Bu = 1$. As with the reference state of\n$\\epsilon=1$, for $\\epsilon < 1$ the wave mode energy saturates quite quickly\nand the ensuing forward cascade continues to act as an efficient means of\ndissipating ageostrophic energy. Further, these saturated spectra steepen as\n$\\epsilon$ decreases: we see a shift from $k^{-1}$ to $k^{-5/3}$ scaling for\n$k_f < k < k_d$ (where $k_f$ and $k_d$ are the forcing and dissipation scales,\nrespectively). On the other hand, when $\\epsilon > 1$ the wave mode energy\nnever saturates and comes to dominate the total energy in the system. In fact,\nin a sense the wave modes behave in an asymmetric manner about $\\epsilon = 1$.\nWith regard to the vortical modes, for $\\epsilon \\le 1$, the signatures of 3D\nquasigeostrophy are clearly evident. Specifically, we see a $k^{-3}$ scaling\nfor $k_f < k < k_d$ and, in accord with an inverse transfer of energy, the\nvortical mode energy never saturates but rather increases for all $k < k_f$. In\ncontrast, for $\\epsilon > 1$ and increasing, the vortical modes contain a\nprogressively smaller fraction of the total energy indicating that the 3D\nquasigeostrophic subsystem plays an energetically smaller role in the overall\ndynamics.\n",

Within this context, the most important\nrecent issue has been the dynamics of collaborative innovation among firms. We\ntherefore investigated a patent network, especially focusing on its spatial\ncharacteristics. The results can be summarized as follows. (1) The degree\ndistribution in a patent network follows a power law. A firm can then be\nconnected to many firms via hubs connected to the firm. (2) The neighbors'\naverage degree has a null correlation, but the clustering coefficient has a\nnegative correlation. The latter means that there is a hierarchical structure\nand bridging different modules may shorten the paths between the nodes in them.\n(3) The distance of links not only indicates the regional accumulations of\nfirms, but the importance of time it takes to travel, which plays a key role in\ncreating links. (4) The ratio of internal links in cities indicates that we\nhave to consider the existing links firms have to facilitate the creation of\nnew links.\n",

As a first step towards the eventual determination\nof Higgs mass bounds we study the phase diagram of the model analytically in\nthe large Nf-limit. We present an expression for the effective potential at\ntree-level in the regime of small Yukawa and quartic coupling constants and\ndetermine the order of the phase transitions. In the case of strong Yukawa\ncouplings the model effectively becomes an O(4)-symmetric non-linear\nsigma-model for all values of the quartic coupling constant. This leads to the\nexistence of a symmetric phase also in the regime of large values of the Yukawa\ncoupling constant. On finite and small lattices, however, strong finite volume\neffects prevent the expectation value of the Higgs field from vanishing thus\nobscuring the existence of the symmetric phase at strong Yukawa couplings.\n",

        "abstract": "  Many systems of different nature exhibit scale free behaviors. Economic\nsystems with power law distribution in the wealth is one of the examples. To\nbetter understand the working behind the complexity, we undertook an empirical\nstudy measuring the interactions between market participants. A Web server was\nsetup to administer the exchange of futures contracts whose liquidation prices\nwere coupled to event outcomes. After free registration, participants started\ntrading to compete for the money prizes upon maturity of the futures contracts\nat the end of the experiment. The evolving `cash' flow network was\nreconstructed from the transactions between players. We show that the network\ntopology is hierarchical, disassortative and scale-free with a power law\nexponent of 1.02+-0.09 in the degree distribution. The small-world property\nemerged early in the experiment while the number of participants was still\nsmall. We also show power law distributions of the net incomes and\ninter-transaction time intervals. Big winners and losers are associated with\nhigh degree, high betweenness centrality, low clustering coefficient and low\ndegree-correlation. We identify communities in the network as groups of the\nlike-minded. The distribution of the community sizes is shown to be power-law\ndistributed with an exponent of 1.19+-0.16.\n",

First, we show that this approach can describe the quarkonium\ncorrelation function at zero temperature. Using a class of screened potentials\nbased on lattice calculations of the static quark-antiquark free energy we\ncalculate spectral functions at finite temperature. We find that all quarkonium\nstates, with the exception of the $1S$ bottomonium, dissolve in the deconfined\nphase at temperatures smaller than $1.5T_c$, in contradiction with the\nconclusions of recent studies. Despite this the temperature dependence of the\nquarkonium correlation functions calculated on the lattice is well reproduced\nin our model. We also find that even in the absence of resonances the spectral\nfunction at high temperatures is significantly enhanced over the spectral\nfunction corresponding to free quark antiquark propagation.\n",

        "abstract": "  The purpose of this article is to show that the introduction of hidden\nvariables to describe individual events is fully consistent with the\nstatistical predictions of quantum theory. We illustrate the validity of this\nassertion by discussing two fundamental experiments on correlated photons which\nare believed to behave ``violently non-classical''. Our considerations carry\nover to correlated pairs of neutral particles of spin one-half in a singlet\nstate. Much in the spirit of Einstein's conviction we come to the conclusion\nthat the state vector of a system does not provide an exhaustive description of\nthe individual physical system. We also briefly discuss an experiment on\n``quantum teleportation'' and demonstrate that our completely local approach\nleads to a full understanding of the experiment indicating the absence of any\nteleportation phenomenon. We caution that the indiscriminated use of the term\n``Quantum Theory'' tends to obscure distinct differences between the quantum\nmechanics of massive particles and the propagation of photons. It is emphasized\nthat the properties of polarizers, beam splitters, halfwave plates etc. used in\nphoton-correlation experiments are defined by the laws of classical optics.\nHence, understanding the outcome of those experiments requires a well-founded\ninterconnection between classical and quantum electrodynamics free from\nunnecessary hypotheses.\n",

The attenuation effect, which depends on the\ndistribution of mass elements into the Sun, was compared with the relativistic\neffect for the orbital elements of planets.

The effect of attenuation\nduring a solar eclipse will produce a local reduction in the soli-lunar\nattraction of 0.13 microgal. This small variation of gravity during the eclipse\ncan lead to distortions of the geoid of about ten millimetres of which effect\non gravity, estimated at a few microgals, is compatible with the observed\ngravitational anomalies. The gravimetric measurements taken in the area of\nMontreal during the Sun eclipse of May 10, 1994, show the existence of an\nanomaly of 2.4 microgals that coincides perfectly with the period of the\neclipse.\n",

        "abstract": "  In the past several decades there have been a number of proposals for\ncomputing with dual forms of non-abelian Yang-Mills theories on the lattice.\nMotivated by the gauge-invariant, geometric picture offered by dual models and\nsuccessful applications of duality in the U(1) case, we revisit the question of\nwhether it is practical to perform numerical computation using non-abelian dual\nmodels. Specifically, we consider three-dimensional SU(2) pure Yang-Mills as an\naccessible yet non-trivial case in which the gauge group is non-abelian. Using\nmethods developed recently in the context of spin foam quantum gravity, we\nderive an algorithm for efficiently computing the dual amplitude and describe\nMetropolis moves for sampling the dual ensemble. We relate our algorithms to\nprior work in non-abelian dual computations of Hari Dass and his collaborators,\naddressing several problems that have been left open. We report results of spin\nexpectation value computations over a range of lattice sizes and couplings that\nare in agreement with our conventional lattice computations. We conclude with\nan outlook on further development of dual methods and their application to\nproblems of current interest.\n",

At larger separations Gribov copies obstruct the\nnon-perturbative identification of individually gauge invariant colour states.\nWe demonstrate, for the first time, how gauge invariance can be maintained\nquite generally by averaging over Gribov copies. This allows us to extend the\nanalysis of the Polyakov lines and the corresponding, gauge invariant\nquark-antiquark state to all distance scales. Using large scale lattice\nsimulations, we show that this interpolating state possesses a good overlap\nwith the ground state in the quark-antiquark sector and yields the full static\ninter-quark potential at all distances. A visual representation of the Gribov\ncopies on the lattice is also presented.\n",

It turns\nout that in particular the tails of the distributions are not well described by\nindependent Bernoulli trials, but rather well modeled by negative binomial or\ngeneralized extreme value distributions. To understand this behavior from first\nprinciples, we suggest to modify the Bernoulli random process to include a\nsimple component of self-affirmation which seems to describe the data\nsurprisingly well and allows to interpret the observed deviation from Gaussian\nstatistics. The phenomenological distributions used before can be understood as\nspecial cases within this framework. We analyzed historical football score data\nfrom many leagues in Europe as well as from international tournaments and found\nthe proposed models to be applicable rather universally. In particular, here we\ncompare men's and women's leagues and the separate German leagues during the\ncold war times and find some remarkable differences.\n",

        "abstract": "  The photon box thought experiment can be considered a forerunner of the\nEPR-experiment: by performing suitable measurements on the box it is possible\nto ``prepare'' the photon, long after it has escaped, in either of two\ncomplementary states. Consistency requires that the corresponding box\nmeasurements be complementary as well. At first sight it seems, however, that\nthese measurements can be jointly performed with arbitrary precision: they\npertain to different systems (the center of mass of the box and an internal\nclock, respectively). But this is deceptive. As we show by explicit\ncalculation, although the relevant quantities are simultaneously measurable,\nthey develop non-vanishing commutators when calculated back to the time of\nescape of the photon. This justifies Bohr's qualitative arguments in a precise\nway; and it illustrates how the details of the dynamics conspire to guarantee\nthe requirements of complementarity. In addition, our calculations exhibit a\n``fine structure'' in the distribution of the uncertainties over the\ncomplementary quantities: depending on \\textit{when} the box measurement is\nperformed, the resulting quantum description of the photon differs. This brings\nus close to the argumentation of the later EPR thought experiment.\n",

We propose using this relation to understand gravity and\ndynamics of black objects in higher dimensions. We provide evidence that (i)\nthe gravitational Gregory-Laflamme instability has a classical counterpart in\nthe Rayleigh-Plateau instability of fluids. Each known feature of the\ngravitational instability can be accounted for in the fluid model. These\nfeatures include threshold mode, dispersion relation, time evolution and\ncritical dimension of certain phase transitions. Thus, we argue that black\nstrings break in much the same way as water from a faucet breaks up into small\ndroplets. (ii) General rotating black holes can also be understood with this\nanalogy. In particular, instability and bifurcation diagrams for black objects\ncan easily be inferred. This correspondence can and should be used as a guiding\ntool to understand and explore physics of gravity in higher dimensions.\n",

The theory explains the several experimental findings of the\ntemporal scale invariance as well as deviation from this of current transients\nin terms of three dominant fractal parameters for the limited-length scales of\nroughness. This theoretical method is based on limited scale power-law\ncharacterization of the interfacial roughness spectrum and the solution of\ndiffusion equation under the diffusion-limited boundary conditions on rough\ninterfaces. More broadly, these calculations challenges the earlier belief that\nthe anomalous behavior is solely dependent on fractal dimension of roughness\nand highlight the potential to apply this equation for the scale invariant\nroughness determination. Finally, the validity of theoretical result is tested\nwith extensive experimental data.\n",

        "abstract": "  A three-dimensional nonlinear dynamo process is identified in rotating plane\nCouette flow in the Keplerian regime. It is analogous to the hydrodynamic\nself-sustaining process in non-rotating shear flows and relies on the\nmagneto-rotational instability of a toroidal magnetic field. Steady nonlinear\nsolutions are computed numerically for a wide range of magnetic Reynolds\nnumbers but are restricted to low Reynolds numbers. This process may be\nimportant to explain the sustenance of coherent fields and turbulent motions in\nKeplerian accretion disks, where all its basic ingredients are present.\n",

        "abstract": "  In this paper, it is shown that the cosmological model that was introduced in\na sequence of three earlier papers under the title, A Dust Universe Solution to\nthe Dark Energy Problem can be used to analyse and solve the Cosmological\nCoincidence Problem. The generic coincidence problem that appears in the\noriginal Einstein universe model is shown to arise from a misunderstanding\nabout the magnitude of dark energy density and the epoch time governing the\nappearance of the integer relation between dark energy and normal energy\ndensity. The solution to the generic case then clearly points to the source of\nthe time coincidence integer problem in the Friedman dust universe model. It is\nthen possible to eliminate this coincidence by removing a degeneracy between\ndifferent measurement epoch times. In this paper's first appendix, a\nfundamental time dependent relation between dark mass and dark energy is\nderived with suggestions how this relation could explain cosmological voids and\nthe clumping of dark mass to become visible matter. In this paper's second\nappendix, it is shown that that dark energy is a conserved with time substance\nthat is everywhere and for all time permeable to the dark mass and visible mass\nof which the contracting or expanding universe is composed. The last two\nappendices involve detailed studies of cosmology, quantum dark energy related\nissues. There are more detailed abstracts given with all four appendices.\n",

It is a negative matter with some new characteristics, which are\nmainly the gravitation each other, but the repulsion with all positive matter.\nSuch the positive and negative matters are two regions of topological\nseparation in general case, and the negative matter is invisible. It is the\nsimplest candidate of dark matter, and can explain some characteristics of the\ndark matter and dark energy. Recent phantom on dark energy is namely a negative\nmatter. We propose that in quantum fluctuations the positive matter and\nnegative matter are created at the same time, and derive an inflation cosmos,\nwhich is created from nothing. The Higgs mechanism is possibly a product of\npositive and negative matter. Based on a basic axiom and the two foundational\nprinciples of the negative matter, we research its predictions and possible\ntheoretical tests, in particular, the season effect. The negative matter should\nbe a necessary development of Dirac theory. Finally, we propose the three basic\nlaws of the negative matter. The existence of four matters on positive,\nopposite, and negative, negative-opposite particles will form the most perfect\nsymmetrical world.\n",

The calculations are\ncarried out in the simple one dimensional magnetohydrodynamical model using the\napproximations which allow one to find the purely analytical spectra of\nmagneto-gravity waves beyond the scope of the JWKB approximation and avoid in a\nsmall background magnetic field the appearance of the cusp resonance which\nlocks a wave within the radiative zone. These analytic results are compared\nwith the satellite observations of the g-mode frequency shifts which are of the\norder one per cent as given in the GOLF experiment at the SoHO board. The main\ncontribution turns out to be the magnetic frequency shift in the strong\nmagnetic field which obeys the used approximations. In particular, the fixed\nmagnetic field strength 700 KG results in the mentioned value of the frequency\nshift for the g-mode of the radial order n=-10. The rotational shift due to the\nCoriolis force appears to be small and does not exceed a fracton of per cent,\n\\alpha_\\Omega < 0.003.\n",

        "abstract": "  We consider a large class of optical cavities and gain media with an off-axis\nexternal feedback which introduces a two-point nonlocality. This nonlocality\nmoves the lasing threshold and opens large windows of control parameters where\nweak light spots can be strongly amplified while the background radiation\nremains very low. Furthermore, transverse phase and group velocities of a\nsignal can be independently tuned and this enables to steer it non\nmechanically, to control its spatial chirping and to split it into two\ncounter-propagating ones.\n",

In addition, an inertial range is very difficult to detect and it\nis questionable whether it exists at all. Here, we investigate the transition\nof Eulerian to Lagrangian probability density functions (PDFs) which leads to a\nnew type of Lagrangian structure function. This possesses an extended inertial\nrange similar to the case of tracer particles in a frozen turbulent velocity\nfield. This allows a connection to the scaling of Eulerian transversal\nstructure functions.\n",

The design is very appealing due to its simplicity, promising a\ncleaner experimental realisation than previously studied microcavity designs on\nthe one hand and analytic tractability based on Green's function techniques and\nself-adjoint extension theory on the other.\n",

While E is still more widely used, F-A-Dex has\nbeen gaining in popularity for practical reasons among experimentalists who\nstudy biomembranes. Here, for the special case of membrane-bound fluorophores,\nwe present a substantial body of experimental evidence that justifies the use\nof simple Stern-Volmer expressions when modeling either FRET metric under\ndilute-probe conditions. We have also discovered a dilute-regime correspondence\nbetween our Stern-Volmer expression for E and Wolber and Hudson's series\napproximation for steady-state Forster quenching in 2D. This novel\ncorrespondence allows us to interpret each of our 2D quenching constants in\nterms of both (i) an effective Forster distance, and (ii) two maximum\nacceptor-concentration limits, each of which defines its own useful\nexperimental regime. Taken together, our results suggest a three-step strategy\ntoward designing more effective steady-state FRET experiments for the study of\nbiomembranes.\n",

When the information refers to a particular node at\nwhich both quantities are measured, the model can be taken as a model for\ngossip propagation. In this context, we apply the model to real empirical\nnetworks of social acquaintances and compare the underlying spreading dynamics\nwith different types of scale-free and small-world networks.

The p_T spectrum for the \"head\" region softens toward central\ncollisions, consistent with the onset of jet quenching. The spectral slope for\nthe \"shoulder\" region is independent of centrality and trigger p_T, which\noffers constraints on energy transport mechanisms and suggests that the\n\"shoulder\" region contains the medium response to energetic jets.\n",

By matching the lowest-lying eigenvalue we extract the chiral\ncondensate, \\Sigma(2 GeV)[MSbar] = [251(7)(11) MeV]^3, where errors represent\nstatistical and higher order effects in the epsilon expansion. We also\ncalculate the eigenvalue distributions on the lattices with heavier sea quarks\nat two lattice spacings.

Here we carry out the first comparative study\nof lattice (Landau) propagators for these two gauge groups. Our data were\nespecially produced with equivalent lattice parameters in order to allow a\ncareful comparison of the two cases. We find very good agreement between SU(2)\nans SU(3) propagators, showing that in the IR limit the equivalence of the two\ncases is quantitative, at least down to about 1 GeV. Our results suggest that\nthe infrared behavior of these propagators is independent of the gauge group\nSU(N_c), as predicted by Schwinger-Dyson equations.\n",

To get\na first idea of the phase structure, the model is analyzed in strong coupling\nexpansion and using a mean field approximation. In numerical simulations, the\nmodel still shows the so-called sign problem, a difficulty peculiar to non-zero\nchemical potential, but it permits the development of algorithms which ensure a\ngood overlap of the Monte Carlo ensemble with the true one. We review the main\nfeatures of the model and present calculations concerning the dependence of\nvarious observables on the chemical potential and on the temperature, in\nparticular of the charge density and the diquark susceptibility, which may be\nused to characterize the various phases expected at high baryonic density. We\nobtain in this way information about the phase structure of the model and the\ncorresponding phase transitions and cross over regions, which can be considered\nas hints for the behaviour of non-zero density QCD.\n",

Definitions are revisited and clarified in light of\ninconsistencies in the literature. We point out that, in general oscillating\nflows, Navier's slip length b is a complex number. An intuitive velocity\ndiscontinuity parameter of unrestricted phase is used to describe the effect of\nslip on measurement of viscous shear damping. The analysis is applied to the\ncomposite oscillator and preliminary experimental work for a 40 kHz oscillator\nis presented. The Non-Slip Boundary Condition (NSBC) has been verified for a\nhydrophobic surface in water to within ~60 nm of |b|=0 nm. Experiments were\ncarried out at shear rate amplitudes between 230 and 6800 /s, corresponding to\nlinear displacement amplitudes between 3.2 and 96 nm.\n",

The study is performed in\nthe framework of lubrication theory, in which the hydrodynamics is resolved at\nall length scales (from molecular to macroscopic). We investigate the\nbifurcation diagram for unperturbed contact lines, which turns out to be more\ncomplex than expected from simplified 'quasi-static' theories based upon an\napparent contact angle. Linear stability analysis reveals that below the\ncritical capillary number of entrainment, Ca_c, the contact line is linearly\nstable at all wavenumbers. Away from the critical point the dispersion relation\nhas an asymptotic behaviour sigma~|q| and compares well to a quasi-static\napproach. Approaching Ca_c, however, a different mechanism takes over and the\ndispersion evolves from |q| to the more common q^2. These findings imply that\ncontact lines can not be treated as universal objects governed by some\neffective law for the macroscopic contact angle, but viscous effects have to be\ntreated explicitly.\n",

We first\ncharacterize stationary menisci and their breakdown at the coating transition.\nIt is then shown that the dynamics of both liquid deposition and\nlong-wavelength perturbations adiabatically follow these stationary states.\nThis provides a first experimental access to the entire bifurcation diagram of\ndynamical wetting, confirming the hydrodynamic theory developed in Part 1. In\ncontrast to quasi-static theories based on a dynamic contact angle, we\ndemonstrate that the transition strongly depends on the large scale flow\ngeometry. We then establish the dispersion relation for large wavenumbers, for\nwhich we find that sigma is linear in q. The speed dependence of sigma is well\ndescribed by hydrodynamic theory, in particular the absence of diverging\ntime-scales at the critical point. Finally, we highlight some open problems\nrelated to contact angle hysteresis that lead beyond the current description.\n",

We compare the analytic continuation of these results with\nvarious phenomenological models, none of which provides a satisfactory\ndescription of data, a failure on which we make some comments. These results\ncomplement and extend the information obtained via the analysis of the\nsusceptibilities evaluated at zero mu, yielding a simple description of the\ncandidate strongly interacting QGP phase. As a byproduct of our analysis we\ninvestigate the Polyakov loop and its hermitian conjugate. Our data offer a\nvivid evidence of the importance of the complex nature of the functional\nintegral measure, which results in L (mu) ne \\bar L(mu) for a real chemical\npotential.\n",

We point out that these three models\nhave close relationships; the N =(2,2) model by Catterall [Catterall] and the\ntwo-dimensional N = (2,2) lattice theory being similar to Sugino's construction\n[Sugino] can be derived by appropriate truncation of fields in the\ntwo-dimensional N = (4,4) orbifold lattice theory by CKKU [Cohen et al].\nCatterall's N = (2,2) description possesses extra degrees of freedom compared\nto the target N = (2,2) theory. If we remove those extra degrees of freedom in\na way keeping supersymmetry on the lattice, Catterall's description reduces to\na model of the Sugino type.\n",

Governing\nmacroscopic equations are derived starting from the space-averaged microscopic\nmass and momentum balances. The Reynolds stress models (i.e., momentum\ndispersive fluxes) are discussed, and a suitable model is developed. In the\ncase of granular media the solid constituent is considered as an\nelastic-plastic matrix, and the yield condition is approximated by Coulomb\nfriction law. It is revealed that the classical principle of maximum plastic\nwork is not, in general, valid for granular media, and an appropriate\nvariational principle is developed. This novel principle coincides with the\nmaximum plastic work principle for the case of cohesionless and free from\ninternal friction granular media.\n",

        "abstract": "  The interaction of two isotropic turbulent fields of equal integral scale but\ndifferent kinetic energy generates the simplest kind of inhomogeneous turbulent\nfield. In this paper we present a numerical experiment where two time decaying\nisotropic fields of kinetic energies $E_1$ and $E_2$ initially match over a\nnarrow region. Within this region the kinetic energy varies as a hyperbolic\ntangent. The following temporal evolution produces a shearless mixing. The\nanisotropy and intermittency of velocity and velocity derivative statistics is\nobserved. In particular the asymptotic behavior in time and as a function of\nthe energy ratio $E_1/E_2 \\to \\infty$ is discussed. This limit corresponds to\nthe maximum observable turbulent energy gradient for a given $E_1$ and is\nobtained through the limit $E_2 \\to 0$. A field with $E_1/E_2 \\to \\infty$\nrepresents a mixing which could be observed near a surface subject to a very\nsmall velocity gradient separating two turbulent fields, one of which is nearly\nquiescent. In this condition the turbulent penetration is maximum and reaches a\nvalue equal to 1.2 times the nominal mixing layer width. The experiment shows\nthat the presence of a turbulent energy gradient is sufficient for the\nappearance of intermittency and that during the mixing process the pressure\ntransport is not negligible with respect to the turbulent velocity transport.\nThese findings may open the way to the hypothesis that the presence of a\ngradient of turbulent energy is the minimal requirement for Gaussian departure\nin turbulence.\n",

We extend the standard log-normal process to include another\nrandom component in the so-called stochastic volatility models. We study these\nmodels under an assumption, akin to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, in\nwhich the volatility has already relaxed to its equilibrium distribution and\nacts as a background to the evolution of the price process. In this\napproximation, we show that all models of stochastic volatility should exhibit\na scaling relation in the time lag of zero-drift modified log-returns. We\nverify that the Dow-Jones Industrial Average index indeed follows this scaling.\nWe then focus on two popular stochastic volatility models, the Heston and\nHull-White models. In particular, we show that in the Hull-White model the\nresulting probability distribution of log-returns in this approximation\ncorresponds to the Tsallis (t-Student) distribution. The Tsallis parameters are\ngiven in terms of the microscopic stochastic volatility model. Finally, we show\nthat the log-returns for 30 years Dow Jones index data is well fitted by a\nTsallis distribution, obtaining the relevant parameters.\n",

Pade approximants to the complex-energy\ntrajectories are used to perform an extrapolation of the resonance energies,\nwhich, thus, become independent of the respective stabilization parameter.\nWithin the monopole approximation to the two-center potential is demonstrated\nthat the extrapolated results from SES and CAP are consistent to a high degree\nof accuracy. Extrapolated CAP calculations are extended to include dipole and\nquadrupole terms of the potential for a large range of internuclear separations\nR. These terms cause a broadening of the widths at the permille level when the\nnuclei are almost in contact, and at the % level for R values where the ground\nstate enters the negative continuum.\n",

        "abstract": "  Avalanches, or Avalanche-like, events are often observed in the dynamical\nbehaviour of many complex systems which span from solar flaring to the Earth's\ncrust dynamics and from traffic flows to financial markets. Self-organized\ncriticality (SOC) is one of the most popular theories able to explain this\nintermittent charge/discharge behaviour. Despite a large amount of theoretical\nwork, empirical tests for SOC are still in their infancy. In the present paper\nwe address the common problem of revealing SOC from a simple time series\nwithout having much information about the underlying system. As a working\nexample we use a modified version of the multifractal random walk originally\nproposed as a model for the stock market dynamics. The study reveals, despite\nthe lack of the typical ingredients of SOC, an avalanche-like dynamics similar\nto that of many physical systems. While, on one hand, the results confirm the\nrelevance of cascade models in representing turbulent-like phenomena, on the\nother, they also raise the question about the current state of reliability of\nSOC inference from time series analysis.\n",

Iterating this process, a network grows. We\ninvestigate properties of this type of growing networks, especially the degree\ndistribution and time-depending strategy distribution by running computer\nsimulation. We also find a sort of phase transition in the strategy\ndistributions. For these phenomena given by computer simulation, theoretical\nstudies are also carried out.\n",

We find considerable effects in the quark mass function\nat low momenta as well as for the chiral condensate. The quark wave function is\nless affected.

In the last years, the problem of community detection has been\nreformulated in terms of the optimization of a function, the Newman-Girvan\nmodularity, that is supposed to express the quality of the partitions of a\nnetwork into communities. Starting from a recent critical survey on modularity\noptimization, pointing out the existence of a resolution limit that poses\nsevere limits to its applicability, we discuss the general issue of the use of\nquality functions in community detection. Our main conclusion is that quality\nfunctions are useful to compare partitions with the same number of modules,\nwhereas the comparison of partitions with different numbers of modules is not\nstraightforward and may lead to ambiguities.\n",

Our equation generalizes\nprevious results, obtained for the normal propagation of electromagnetic waves\nin stratified media. It is valid for curvilinear rays with torsion and is\ncapable to describe normal modes conversion in the inhomogeneous media.\nRemarkably, evolution of the Stokes vector is described by the\nBargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation for relativistic spin precession, whereas the\nequation for the three-component Stokes vector resembles the Landau-Lifshitz\nequation for spin precession in ferromegnetic systems. General theory is\napplied for analysis of polarization evolution in a magnetized plasma.

This model extends blockmodels for\nrelational data to ones which capture mixed membership latent relational\nstructure, thus providing an object-specific low-dimensional representation. We\ndevelop a general variational inference algorithm for fast approximate\nposterior inference. We explore applications to social and protein interaction\nnetworks.\n",

The two limiting cases are\nconsidered. In the first case where the energy of the accelerated electrons is\nlow, the electron makes many betatron oscillations during the acceleration. In\nthe second case where the energy of the accelerated electrons is high, the\nbetatron oscillation period is longer than the electron residence time in the\naccelerating phase. We show that the force of radiative friction can severely\nlimit the rate of electron acceleration in a plasma accelerator.\n",

The resulting graphs are made of\nclusters of occupied sites.

        "abstract": "  We study a modified version of a model previously proposed by Jackson and\nWolinsky to account for communicating information and allocating goods in\nsocioeconomic networks. In the model, the utility function of each node is\ngiven by a weighted sum of contributions from all accessible nodes. The\nweights, parameterized by the variable $\\delta$, decrease with distance. We\nintroduce a growth mechanism where new nodes attach to the existing network\npreferentially by utility. By increasing $\\delta$, the network structure\nevolves from a power-law to an exponential degree distribution, passing through\na regime characterised by shorter average path length, lower degree\nassortativity and higher central point dominance. In the second part of the\npaper we compare different network structures in terms of the average utility\nreceived by each node. We show that power-law networks provide higher average\nutility than Poisson random networks. This provides a possible justification\nfor the ubiquitousness of scale-free networks in the real world.\n",

In this work we show that when such a mixed action effective\nfield theory is projected onto the valence sector, both the Lagrangian and the\nextrapolation formulae become universal in form through next to leading order,\nfor all variants of discretization methods used for the sea fermions. Our\nconclusion relies on the chiral nature of the valence quarks. The result\nimplies that for all sea quark methods which are in the same universality class\nas QCD, the numerical values of the physical coefficients in the various mixed\naction chiral Lagrangians will be the same up to lattice spacing dependent\ncorrections. This allows us to construct a prescription to determine the mixed\naction extrapolation formulae for a large class of hadronic correlation\nfunctions computed in partially quenched chiral perturbation theory at the\none-loop level. For specific examples, we apply this prescription to the\nnucleon twist--2 matrix elements and the nucleon--nucleon system. In addition,\nwe determine the mixed action extrapolation formula for the neutron EDM as this\nprovides a nice example of a theta-dependent observable; these observables are\nexceptions to our prescription.\n",

In a previous paper (Greenshields &\nReese, 2007), we found these modifications gave good predictions of the viscous\nstructure of shock waves in argon in the range Mach 1.0-12.0 (while\nconventional Navier-Stokes equations are known to fail above about Mach 2).\nHowever, some areas of concern with this model were a somewhat arbitrary choice\nof modelling coefficient, and potentially unphysical and unstable solutions. In\nthis paper, we therefore present slightly different modifications to include\nmolecule mass diffusion fully in the Navier-Stokes equations. These\nmodifications are shown to be stable and produce physical solutions to the\nshock problem of a quality broadly similar to those from the family of extended\nhydrodynamic models that includes the Burnett equations. The modifications\nprimarily add a diffusion term to the mass conservation equation, so are at\nleast as simple to solve as the Navier-Stokes equations; there are none of the\nnumerical implementation problems of conventional extended hydrodynamics\nmodels, particularly in respect of boundary conditions. We recommend further\ninvestigation and testing on a number of different benchmark non-equilibrium\nflow cases.\n",

We\nalso show how to use this distance to measure the stability of filtering\nprocedures with respect to statistical uncertainty. We explain the\neffectiveness of our method by comparing four filtering procedures, two of them\nbeing based on spectral analysis and the other two on hierarchical clustering.\nWe compare these techniques as applied both to simulations of factor models and\nempirical data. We investigate the ability of these filtering procedures in\nrecovering the correlation matrix of models from simulations. We discuss such\nan ability in terms of both the heterogeneity of model parameters and the\nlength of data series. We also show that the two spectral techniques are\ntypically more informative about the sample correlation matrix than techniques\nbased on hierarchical clustering, whereas the latter are more stable with\nrespect to statistical uncertainty.\n",

In general, the cooperative folding routes have sharper\ninterfaces between folded and unfolded regions of the folding nucleus and\nhigher free energy barriers. The calculated free energy barriers are strongly\ncorrelated with native topology as characterized by contact order. Increasing\nthe rigidity of the folding nucleus changes the local structure of the\ntransition state ensemble non-uniformly across the set of protein studied.\nNeverthless, the calculated prefactors k0 are found to be relatively uniform\nacross the protein set, with variation in 1/k0 less than a factor of five. This\ndirect calculation justifies the common assumption that the prefactor is\nroughly the same for all small two-state folding proteins. Using the barrier\nheights obtained from the model and the best fit monomer relaxation time 30ns,\nwe find that 1/k0 (1-5)us (with average 1/k0 4us).

In this review I will mostly report on\nthe theoretical issues. Two non-perturbative methods are privileged frameworks\nfor studying these properties in the low energy domain: chiral perturbation\ntheory, the effective field theory of the Standard Model at energies below 1\nGeV and lattice QCD. I will mainly concentrate here on the first one but I will\nalso discuss the complementarity of the two methods. Chiral extrapolations for\nlattice simulations of some nucleon properties will be investigated. I will\nthen concentrate on processes involving at most two nucleons, describing for\nexample pion-nucleon and pion-deuteron scattering, pion photo- and\nelectroproduction off the nucleon and the deuteron and doubly virtual Compton\nscattering. Three flavor calculations will also be reviewed.\n",

        "abstract": "  The dynamics of information dissemination in social networks is of paramount\nimportance in processes such as rumors or fads propagation, spread of product\ninnovations or \"word-of-mouth\" communications. Due to the difficulty in\ntracking a specific information when it is transmitted by people, most\nunderstanding of information spreading in social networks comes from models or\nindirect measurements. Here we present an integrated experimental and\ntheoretical framework to understand and quantitatively predict how and when\ninformation spreads over social networks. Using data collected in Viral\nMarketing campaigns that reached over 31,000 individuals in eleven European\nmarkets, we show the large degree of variability of the participants' actions,\ndespite them being confronted with the common task of receiving and forwarding\nthe same piece of information. This have a profound effect on information\ndiffusion: Firstly, most of the transmission takes place due to super-spreading\nevents which would be considered extraordinary in population-average models.\nSecondly, due to the different way individuals schedule information\ntransmission we observe a slowing down of the spreading of information in\nsocial networks that happens in logarithmic time. Quantitative description of\nthe experiments is possible through an stochastic branching process which\ncorroborates the importance of heterogeneity. Since high variability of both\nthe intensity and frequency of human responses are found in many other\nactivities, our findings are pertinent to many other human driven diffusion\nprocesses like rumors, fads, innovations or news which has important\nconsequences for organizations management, communications, marketing or\nelectronic social communities.\n",

The pioneering work by Nowak and May showed that large\ninitial populations of cooperators can survive and sustain cooperation in a\nsquare lattice with imitate-the-best evolutionary dynamics. We revisit this\nproblem in a cost-benefit formulation suitable for a number of biological\napplications. We show that if a fixed-amount reward is established for\ncooperators to share, a single cooperator can invade a population of defectors\nand form structures that are resilient to re-invasion even if the reward\nmechanism is turned off. We discuss analytically the case of the invasion by a\nsingle cooperator and present agent-based simulations for small initial\nfractions of cooperators. Large cooperation levels, in the sustainability\nrange, are found. In the conclusions we discuss possible applications of this\nmodel as well as its connections with other mechanisms proposed to promote the\nemergence of cooperation.\n",

        "abstract": "  Liesegang patterns emerge from precipitation processes and may be used to\nbuild bulk structures at submicron lengthscales. Thus they have significant\npotential for technological applications provided adequate methods of control\ncan be devised. Here we describe a simple, physically realizable\npattern-control based on the notion of driven precipitation, meaning that the\nphase-separation is governed by a guiding field such as, for example, a\ntemperature or a pH field. The phase-separation is modeled through a\nnon-autonomous Cahn-Hilliard equation whose spinodal is determined by the\nevolving guiding field. Control over the dynamics of the spinodal gives control\nover the velocity of the instability front which separates the stable and\nunstable regions of the system. Since the wavelength of the pattern is largely\ndetermined by this velocity, the distance between successive precipitation\nbands becomes controllable. We demonstrate the above ideas by numerical studies\nof a 1D system with diffusive guiding field. We find that the results can be\naccurately described by employing a linear stability analysis (pulled-front\ntheory) for determining the velocity -- local-wavelength relationship. From the\nperspective of the Liesegang theory, our results indicate that the so-called\nrevert patterns may be naturally generated by diffusive guiding fields.\n",

        "abstract": "  A non-local cascade model for anisotropic MHD turbulence in the presence of a\nguiding magnetic field is proposed. The model takes into account that (a)\nenergy cascades in an anisotropic manner and as a result a different estimate\nfor the cascade rate in the direction parallel and perpendicular to the guiding\nfield is made. (b) the interactions that result in the cascade are between\ndifferent scales. Eddies with wave numbers $k_\\|$ and $k_\\perp$ interact with\neddies with wave numbers $q_\\|,q_\\perp$ such that a resonance condition between\nthe wave numbers $q_\\|,q_\\perp$ and $k_\\|,k_\\perp$ holds. As a consequence\nenergy from the eddy with wave numbers $k_\\|$ and $k_\\perp$ cascades due to\ninteractions with eddies located in the resonant manifold whose wavenumbers are\ndetermined by: $q_\\|\\simeq \\epsilon^{{1}/{3}}k_\\perp^{2/3}/B$,\n$q_\\perp=k_\\perp$ and energy will cascade along the lines $k_\\|\\sim\nC+k_\\perp^{2/3} \\epsilon^{1/3}/B_0$. For a uniform energy injection rate in the\nparallel direction the resulting energy spectrum is $E(k_\\|,k_\\perp)\\simeq\n\\epsilon^{2/3}k_\\|^{-1}k_\\perp^{-5/3}$. For a general forcing however the model\nsuggests a non-universal behavior. The connections with previous models,\nnumerical simulations and weak turbulence theory are discussed.\n",

We\nfind that an antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase appears as the PAH reaches a certain\nsize. This AFM phase in PAHs has the same origin as the one in infinitely long\nzigzag-edged graphene nanoribbons, namely, from the localized electronic state\nat the zigzag edge. The smallest PAH still having an AFM ground state is\nidentified. With increased length of the zigzag edge, PAHs approach an\ninfinitely long ribbon in terms of (1) the energetic ordering and difference\namong the AFM, ferromagnetic (FM), and nonmagnetic (NM) phases and (2) the\naverage local magnetic moment at the zigzag edges. These PAHs serve as ideal\ntargets for chemical synthesis of nanographenes that possess magnetic\nproperties. Moreover, our calculations support the interpretation that\nexperimentally observed magnetism in activated carbon fibers originates from\nthe zigzag edges of the nanographenes.\n",

A numerical simulation up to 100 vortices in a\nsquare periodic box is performed with various initial conditions, including\nsingle and double rows, uniform spacing, checkered pattern, and complete\nspatial randomness. Point process theory in spatial ecology is applied in order\nto quantify clustering of the distribution of vortices. In many cases,\nclustering of the distribution persists after a long time if the initial\ncondition is clustered. In the case of positive and negative vortices with the\nsame absolute value of strength, the $L$ function becomes positive for both\ntypes of vortices. Scattering or recoupling of pairs of vortices by a third\nvortex is remarkable.\n",

The splitting of the full partition function into \"light\" and\n\"mirror\" is well defined only if the two sectors are separately anomaly free.\nWe show that only then is the generating functional, and hence the spectrum, of\nthe mirror theory a smooth function of the gauge field background. This\nexplains how ideas to use additional non-gauge, high-scale mirror-sector\ndynamics to decouple the mirror fermions without breaking the gauge\nsymmetry--for example, in symmetric phases at strong mirror Yukawa\ncoupling--are forced to respect the anomaly-free condition when combined with\nthe exact lattice chiral symmetry. Our results also explain a paradox posed by\na recent numerical study of the mirror-fermion spectrum in a toy\nwould-be-anomalous two-dimensional theory. In passing, we prove some general\nproperties of the partition functions of arbitrary chiral theories on the\nlattice that should be of interest for further studies in this field.\n",

The\nElectrochemical first-order reversal curve (EC-FORC) diagram for a\ndiscontinuous phase transition (nucleation and growth), such as occurs in\nunderpotential deposition, is characterized by a negative region, while such a\nregion does not exist for a continuous phase transition, such as occurs in the\nelectrosorption of Br on Ag(100). Moreover, for systems with a continuous phase\ntransition, the minima of the individual EC-FORCs trace the equilibrium curve,\neven at very high scan rates. Since obtaining experimental data for the EC-FORC\nmethod would require only a simple reprogramming of the potentiostat used in\nconventional cyclic-voltammetry experiments, we believe that this method has\nsignificant potential for easy, rapid, in-situ analysis of systems undergoing\nelectrochemical deposition.\n",

However,\nusing a modified version of their model does not help to find plane Couette\nflow solution in the limit of vanishing symmetry-preserving perturbations\neither.

Electrostatic simulations of linear ion Landau damping in an ion\nacoustic wave, nonlinear reduction of damping due to ion trapping, and\nnonlinear frequency shifts due to ion trapping establish a baseline for\nmodeling the electromagnetic SBS simulations. Systematic scans of the laser\nintensity have been undertaken with both one-dimensional particle simulations\nand coupled-mode-equations integrations, and two values of the electron-to-ion\ntemperature ratio (to vary the linear ion Landau damping) are considered. Three\nof the four intensity scans have evidence of SBS inflation as determined by\nobserving more reflectivity in the particle simulations than in the\ncorresponding three-wave mode-coupling integrations with a linear ion-wave\nmodel, and the particle simulations show evidence of ion trapping.\n",

Permanent\ntrapping of aerosols much heavier than the advecting fluid is shown to occur in\nall these cases. This phenomenon is determined by the occurrence of multiple\nvortices in the flow and is predicted to happen for realistic particle-fluid\ndensity ratios.\n",

A\ndetailed analysis of material decomposition is performed using a\nthermodynamically complete equation of state with separate stable and\nmetastable phase states and phase boundaries. The lifetime of the metastable\nliquid state is estimated based on the classical theory of homogeneous\nnucleation. In addition, mechanical fragmentation of the target material is\ncontrolled based on available criteria. As a result, several ablation\nmechanisms are observed. A major fraction of the ablated material, however, is\nfound to originate from the metastable liquid region, which is decomposed\neither thermally in the vicinity of the critical point into a liquid-gas\nmixture, or mechanically at high strain rate and negative pressure into liquid\ndroplets and chunks. The calculation results explain available experimental\nfindings.\n",

The effect of dynamical fermions is included by re-weighting a\nquenched ensemble by the pfaffian factor. It appears that the complex phase of\nthe pfaffian due to lattice artifacts and flat directions of the classical\npotential are not problematic in Monte Carlo simulation. Various one-point\nsupersymmetric Ward-Takahashi (WT) identities are examined for lattice spacings\nup to $a=0.5/g$ with the fixed physical lattice size $L=4.0/g$, where $g$\ndenotes the gauge coupling constant in two dimensions. WT identities implied by\nan exact fermionic symmetry of the formulation are confirmed in fair accuracy\nand, for most of these identities, the quantum effect of dynamical fermions is\nclearly observed. For WT identities expected only in the continuum limit, the\nresults seem to be consistent with the behavior expected from supersymmetry,\nalthough we do not see clear distintion from the quenched simulation.

For example, as we consider here, some products might\ncarry environmental or `green' benefits. Some consumers might value these\nbenefits while others do not. However, as evidenced by myriad failed attempts\nof environmental products to maintain even a niche market, such benefits do not\nnecessarily outweigh the extra purchasing cost. The question we pose is, how\ncan such an initially economically-disadvantaged green product evolve to hold\nthe greater share of the market? We present a simple mathematical model for the\ndynamics of product competition in a heterogeneous consumer population. Our\nmodel preassigns a hierarchy to the products, which designates the consumer\nchoice when prices are comparable, while prices are dynamically rescaled to\nreflect increasing returns to scale. Our approach allows us to model many\nscenarios of technology substitution and provides a method for generalizing\nmarket forces. With this model, we begin to forecast irreversible trends\nassociated with consumer dynamics as well as policies that could be made to\ninfluence transitions\n",

The effects of sugars on the protein conformation are\nfound relatively weak, in agreement with the preferential hydration of\nlysozyme. Conversely, sugars seem to increase significantly the relaxation\ntimes of the protein. These effects are shown to be correlated to the\nfractional solvent accessibilities of lysozyme residues and further support the\nslaving of protein dynamics. Moreover, a significant increase in the relaxation\ntimes of lysozyme, sugars and water molecules is observed within the studied\nconcentration range and may result from the percolation of the hydrogen-bond\nnetwork of sugar molecules. This percolation appears to be of primary\nimportance to explain the influence of sugars on the dynamical properties of\nlysozyme and water.\n",

A single\ncompetition is described by a triplet of numbers $p$, $t$ and $q$ denoting the\nprobabilities that the team with the highest, middle or lowest accumulated\nscore wins. We study the full family of solutions in the regime, where the\nnumber of agents and competitions is large, which can be regarded as a\nhydrodynamic limit. Depending on the parameter values $(p,q,t)$, we find six\nqualitatively different asymptotic score distributions and we also provide a\nqualitative understanding of these results. We checked our analytical results\nagainst numerical simulations of the microscopic model and find these to be in\nexcellent agreement. The three agent game can be regarded as a social model\nwhere a player can be favored or disfavored for advancement, based on his/her\naccumulated score. It is also possible to decide the outcome of a three agent\ngame through a mini tournament of two-a gent competitions among the\nparticipating players and it turns out that the resulting possible score\ndistributions are a subset of those obtained for the general three agent-games.\nWe discuss how one can add a steady and democratic decline rate to the model\nand present a simple geometric construction that allows one to write down the\ncorresponding score evolution equations for $n$-agent games.\n",

Quasiperturbative connected quadruple\nexcitations, (Q), converge smoothly as $\\propto L^{-3}$ starting with the\ncc-pVTZ basis set, while the cc-pVDZ basis set causes overshooting of the\ncontribution in highly polar systems. Higher-order connected quadruples display\nonly weak, but somewhat erratic, basis set dependence. Connected quintuple\nexcitations converge very rapidly with the basis set, to the point where even\nan unpolarized double-zeta basis set yields useful numbers. In cases where\nfully iterative CCSDTQ5 (coupled cluster up to connected quintuples)\ncalculations are not an option, CCSDTQ(5) (i.e., coupled cluster up to\nconnected quadruples plus a quasiperturbative connected quintuples correction)\ncannot be relied upon in the presence of significant nondynamical correlation,\nwhereas CCSDTQ(5)$_\\Lambda$ represents a viable alternative. Connected\nquadruples corrections to the core-valence contribution are thermochemically\nsignificant in some systems.

Bubbles result\nfrom self-reinforcing positive feedbacks. This leads to explore uncharted\nterritories and niches whose rare successes lead to extraordinary discoveries\nand provide the base for the observed accelerating development of technology\nand of the economy. But the returns are very heterogeneous, very risky and may\nnot occur. In other words, bubbles, which are characteristic definitions of\nhuman activity, allow huge risks to get huge returns over large scales. We\noutline some underlying mathematical structure and a few results involving\npositive feedbacks, emergence, heavy-tailed power laws, outliers/kings/black\nswans, the problem of predictability and the illusion of control, as well as\nsome policy implications.\n",

In this\npaper, we explore the possibility of approximating this joint law by a\nseparable one in $\\fb$ and in $\\thetab$. This gives the possibility of\ndeveloping iterative algorithms with more reasonable computational cost, in\nparticular, if the approximating laws are choosed in the exponential conjugate\nfamilies.

Thus, we give qualitative\nexplanations to how reversal phenomena stably appear, which seem to arise from\nthe mixing function of the periodic force and the noise.

Next, the second and third\ninvariants for the bounce motion and drift motion, respectively, are obtained\nby successively removing the bounce phase and the drift phase from the\nguiding-center Lagrangian. First-order corrections to the second and third\nadiabatic invariants for a relativistic particle are derived. These results\nsimplify and generalize previous works to all three adiabatic motions of\nrelativistic magnetically-trapped particles.\n",

        "abstract": "  Ignition delay times of cyclohexane-oxygen-argon and\ncyclopentane-oxygen-argon mixtures have been measured in a shock tube, the\nonset of ignition being detected by OH radical emission. Mixtures contained 0.5\nor 1 % of hydrocarbon for equivalence ratios ranging from 0.5 to 2. Reflected\nshock waves allowed temperatures from 1230 to 1800 K and pressures from 7.3 to\n9.5 atm to be obtained. These measurements have shown that cyclopentane is much\nless reactive than cyclohexane, as for a given temperature the observed\nautoignition delay times were about ten times higher for the C5 compound\ncompared to the C6. Detailed mechanisms for the combustion of cyclohexane and\ncyclopentane have been proposed to reproduce these results. The elementary\nsteps included in the kinetic models of the oxidation of cyclanes are close to\nthose proposed to describe the oxidation of acyclic alkanes and alkenes.\nConsequently, it has been possible to obtain these models by using an improved\nversion of software EXGAS, a computer package developed to perform the\nautomatic generation of detailed kinetic models for the gas-phase oxidation and\ncombustion of linear and branched alkanes and alkenes. Nevertheless, the\nmodelling of the oxidation of cyclanes requires to consider new types of\ngeneric reactions, and especially to define new correlations for the estimation\nof the rate constants. Ab initio calculations have been used to better know\nsome of the rate constants used in the case of cyclopentane. The main reaction\npathways have been derived from flow rate and sensitivity analyses.\n",

        "abstract": "  The prediction of auto-ignition delay times in HCCI engines has risen\ninterest on detailed chemical models. This paper described a validated kinetic\nmechanism for the oxidation of a model Diesel fuel (n-decane and\n&#945;-methylnaphthalene). The 3D model for the description of low and high\ntemperature auto-ignition in engines is presented. The behavior of the model\nfuel is compared with that of n-heptane. Simulations show that the 3D model\ncoupled with the kinetic mechanism can reproduce experimental HCCI and Diesel\nengine results and that the correct modeling of auto-ignition in the cool flame\nregion is essential in HCCI conditions.\n",

The rate\nconstants of the reactions involving the formation of bicyclic species\n(isomerizations, formation of cyclic ethers) have been evaluated from\nliterature data. This mechanism is able to satisfactorily reproduce\nexperimental results obtained in a rapid-compression machine for temperatures\nranging from 650 to 900 K and in a jet-stirred reactor from 750 to 1050 K.\nFlow-rate analyses have been performed at low and intermediate temperatures.\n",

The relevant theoretical dilemma is resolved as\nmesoscopic modes that depend critically on the ratio of the transverse (to the\nmagnetic field) to the longitudinal thermal\nconductivity${D^e_{\\perp}/D^e_{\\|}$, can produce large scale magnetic\nreconnection. These modes are envisioned to emerge from a background, which can\nbe coherent, of collisionless microscopic reconnecting modes driven by the\nelectron temperature gradient, that create a sequence of adjacent strings of\nmagnetic islands and increase considerably the ratio ${D^e_{\\perp}/D^e_{\\|}$\nover its classical value.

        "abstract": "  To investigate the formation mechanism of energy spectra of internal waves in\nthe oceans, direct numerical simulations are performed. The simulations are\nbased on the reduced dynamical equations of rotating stratified turbulence. In\nthe reduced dynamical equations only wave modes are retained, and vortices and\nhorizontally uniform vertical shears are excluded. Despite the simplifications,\nour simulations reproduce some key features of oceanic internal-wave spectra:\naccumulation of energy at near-inertial waves and realistic frequency and\nhorizontal wavenumber dependencies. Furthermore, we provide evidence that\nformation of the energy spectra in the inertial subrange is dominated by\nscale-separated interactions with the near-inertial waves. These findings\nsupport oceanographers' intuition that spectral energy density of internal\nwaves is the result of predominantly wave-wave interactions.\n",

Recently, it has been shown that the resolution of methods based on\noptimizing a modularity measure or a corresponding energy is limited;\ncommunities with sizes below some threshold remain unresolved. One possibility\nto go around this problem is to vary the threshold by using a tuning parameter,\nand investigate the community structure at variable resolutions. Here, we\nanalyze the resolution limit and multiresolution behavior for two different\nmethods: a q-state Potts method proposed by Reichard and Bornholdt, and a\nrecent multiresolution method by Arenas, Fernandez, and Gomez. These methods\nare studied analytically, and applied to three test networks using simulated\nannealing.\n",

The\ndistribution of rates, which reproduces the degree distribution of a\npreferential attachment process (Yule process) is derived analytically. We\ndemonstrate with use of simulations that the degree distribution and growth\nrates in single time intervals are similar for the random process and the\npreferential attachment process. Structural differences are analyzed by\nexamining the joint degree distribution and network coreness.\n",

        "abstract": "  One of the main concerns in the design of low emittance linear accelerators\n(linacs) is the preservation of beam emittance. Here we discuss one possible\nsource of emittance dilution, the coupler kick, due to transverse\nelectromagnetic fields in the accelerating cavities of the linac caused by the\npower coupler geometry. In addition to emittance growth, the coupler kick also\nproduces orbit distortions. It is common wisdom that emittance growth from\ncoupler kicks can be strongly reduced by using two couplers per cavity mounted\nopposite each other or by having the couplers of successive cavities\nalternation from above to below the beam pipe so as to cancel each individual\nkick. We therefore analyze consequences of alternate coupler placements.\n  We show here that for sufficiently large Q values, alternating the coupler\nlocation from before to after the cavity leads to a cancellation of the orbit\ndistortion but not of the emittance growth, whereas alternating the coupler\nlocation from before and above to behind and below the cavity cancels the\nemittance growth but not the orbit distortion. These compensations hold even\nwhen each cavity is individually detuned, e.g. by microphonics. Another\neffective method for reducing coupler kicks that is studied is the optimization\nof the phase of the coupler kick. This technique is independent of the coupler\ngeometry but relies on operating on crest. A final technique studied is\nsymmetrization of the cavity geometry in the coupler region with the addition\nof a stub opposite the coupler, which reduces the amplitude of the off axis\nfields and is thus effective for off crest acceleration as well.\n  We show applications of these techniques to the energy recovery linac (ERL)\nplanned at Cornell University.\n",

This exposition will be self-contained and intended for those who are\nnot specialists in quantum field theory, where the technique of dimensional\ncontinuation exploited by BPS first arose. The method is highlighted by the\ninteresting analogy between the Coulomb logarithm of Lyman Spitzer on the one\nhand, and the Lamb shift as calculated by Hans Bethe on the other. BPS employed\nthe method in a novel way that provides the leading and subleading behavior for\nprocesses with competing disparate length or energy scales. They calculated the\ntemperature equilibration rate to leading and next-to-leading order in the\nplasma number density for any two species in a plasma that are in thermal\nequilibrium with themselves, but not necessarily with each other. A special\ncase of this calculation is the electron-ion temperature equilibration rate. It\nshould be emphasized that the BPS result is not a model, but rather it is an\nexact calculation of the leading terms in a well-defined perturbation theory.\nThis exact result differs from approximations and models given in the\nliterature.\n",

This ion density is established as an\nequilibrium between gas ionization and ion clearing. The transverse ion\ndistributions are shown to strongly peak in the beam's center, producing very\nnonlinear forces on the electron beam. We will analyze perturbations to the\nbeam properties by these nonlinear fields. To obtain reasonable simulation\nspeeds, we develop fast algorithms that take advantage of adiabatic invariants\nand scaling properties of Maxwell's equations and the Lorentz force.\n  Our results are very relevant for high current Energy Recovery Linacs, where\nions are produced relatively quickly, and where clearing gaps in the electron\nbeam cannot easily be used for ion elimination. The examples in this paper\ntherefore use parameters of the Cornell Energy Recovery Linac project. For\nsimplicity we only consider the case of a circular electron beam of changing\ndiameter. However, we parameterize this model to approximate non-round beams\nwell. We find suitable places for clearing electrodes and compute the\nequilibrium ion density and its effect on electron-emittance growth and halo\ndevelopment. We find that it is not sufficient to place clearing electrodes\nonly at the minimum of the electron beam potential where ions are accumulated.\n",

Experimental data suggest a self-similar behavior of the\ncritical shear rate and relaxation time as functions of Cs. Specifically, the\nformer ~ Cs^(-6) whereas the latter ~ Cs^(6) such that an effective Weissenberg\nnumber for the onset of the shear thickened phase is only weakly dependent on\nCs. A procedure has been developed to collapse the apparent shear viscosity\nversus shear rate data obtained for various values of Cs into a single master\ncurve. The effect of Cs on the elastic modulus and mesh size of the\nshear-induced gel phase for different surfactant concentrations is discussed.\nExperiments performed using different flow cells (Couette and cone-and-plate)\nshow that the critical shear rate, relaxation time and the maximum viscosity\nattained are geometry-independent. The elastic modulus of the gel phase\ninferred indirectly by employing simplified hydrodynamic instability analysis\nof a sheared gel-fluid interface is in qualitative agreement with that\npredicted for an entangled phase of living polymers. A qualitative mechanism\nthat combines the effect of Cs on average micelle length and Debye parameter\nwith shear-induced configurational changes of rod-like micelles is proposed to\nrationalize the self-similarity of SIS formation.\n",

        "abstract": "  In the framework of mapped pseudospectral methods, we introduce a new\npolynomial-type mapping function in order to describe accurately the dynamics\nof systems developing almost singular structures. Using error criteria related\nto the spectral interpolation error, the new polynomial-type mapping is\ncompared against previously proposed mappings for the study of collapse and\nshock wave phenomena. As a physical application, we study the dynamics of two\ncoupled beams, described by coupled nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations and\nmodeling beam propagation in an atomic coherent media, whose spatial sizes\ndiffers up to several orders of magnitude. It is demonstrated, also by\nnumerical simulations, that the accuracy properties of the new polynomial-type\nmapping outperforms in orders of magnitude the ones of the other studied\nmapping functions.\n",

        "abstract": "  Adaptive populations such as those in financial markets and distributed\ncontrol can be modeled by the Minority Game. We consider how their dynamics\ndepends on the agents' initial preferences of strategies, when the agents use\nlinear or quadratic payoff functions to evaluate their strategies. We find that\nthe fluctuations of the population making certain decisions (the volatility)\ndepends on the diversity of the distribution of the initial preferences of\nstrategies. When the diversity decreases, more agents tend to adapt their\nstrategies together. In systems with linear payoffs, this results in dynamical\ntransitions from vanishing volatility to a non-vanishing one. For low signal\ndimensions, the dynamical transitions for the different signals do not take\nplace at the same critical diversity. Rather, a cascade of dynamical\ntransitions takes place when the diversity is reduced. In contrast, no phase\ntransitions are found in systems with the quadratic payoffs. Instead, a basin\nboundary of attraction separates two groups of samples in the space of the\nagents' decisions. Initial states inside this boundary converge to small\nvolatility, while those outside diverge to a large one. Furthermore, when the\npreference distribution becomes more polarized, the dynamics becomes more\nerratic. All the above results are supported by good agreement between\nsimulations and theory.\n",

Formal equations for the relative sizes in number of edges of\nthese giant structures are derived for arbitrary joint degree distributions in\nthe presence of local and two-point correlations. The uncorrelated null model\nis fully solved analytically and compared against simulations, finding an\nexcellent agreement between the theoretical predictions and the edge\npercolation map of synthetically generated networks with exponential or\nscale-free in-degree distribution and exponential out-degree distribution.\nInterfaces, and their internal organization giving place from \"hairy ball\"\npercolation landscapes to bottleneck straits, could bring new light to the\ndiscussion of how structure is interwoven with functionality, in particular in\nflow networks.\n",

These only occur, however, within\nless energetic regions of (localized) `puff' turbulence at low Reynolds numbers\n(Re=2000-2400), and not at all in (homogeneous) `slug' turbulence at Re=2800.\nThis strongly suggests that all currently known TWs sit in an intermediate\nregion of phase space between the laminar and turbulent states rather than\nbeing embedded within the turbulent attractor itself. New coherent fast streak\nstates with strongly decelerated cores appear to populate the turbulent\nattractor instead.\n",

We find\nthe Fuchsian linear differential equation satisfied by these multiple integrals\nfor $ n=1, 2, 3, 4$ and only modulo some primes for $ n=5$ and $ 6$, thus\nproviding a large set of (possible) new singularities of the $\\chi^{(n)}$. We\ndiscuss the singularity structure for these multiple integrals by solving the\nLandau conditions. We find that the singularities of the associated ODEs\nidentify (up to $n= 6$) with the leading pinch Landau singularities. The second\nremarkable obtained feature is that the singularities of the ODEs associated\nwith the multiple integrals reduce to the singularities of the ODEs associated\nwith a {\\em finite number of one dimensional integrals}. Among the\nsingularities found, we underline the fact that the quadratic polynomial\ncondition $ 1+3 w +4 w^2 = 0$, that occurs in the linear differential equation\nof $ \\chi^{(3)}$, actually corresponds to a remarkable property of selected\nelliptic curves, namely the occurrence of complex multiplication. The\ninterpretation of complex multiplication for elliptic curves as complex fixed\npoints of the selected generators of the renormalization group, namely\nisogenies of elliptic curves, is sketched. Most of the other singularities\noccurring in our multiple integrals are not related to complex multiplication\nsituations, suggesting an interpretation in terms of (motivic) mathematical\nstructures beyond the theory of elliptic curves.\n",

However, properties\nrelated to the network borders (nodes with degree equal to one), one of its\nmost fragile parts, remain little investigated and understood. The border nodes\nmay be involved in the evolution of structures such as geographical networks.\nHere we analyze complex networks by looking for border trees, which are defined\nas the subgraphs without cycles connected to the remainder of the network\n(containing cycles) and terminating into border nodes. In addition to\ndescribing an algorithm for identification of such tree subgraphs, we also\nconsider a series of their measurements, including their number of vertices,\nnumber of leaves, and depth. We investigate the properties of border trees for\nseveral theoretical models as well as real-world networks.\n",

The physical mechanism\nunderlying coherently controlled stationary state scattering is exposed by\nanalyzing a control scenario that relies on previously established entanglement\nrequirements between the scattering partners. Specifically, initial state\nentanglement assures that all collisions in the scattering volume yield the\ndesirable scattering configuration. Scattering is controlled by preparing the\nparticular internal state wave function that leads to the favored collisional\nconfiguration in the collision volume. This insight allows coherent control to\nbe extended to the case of time-dependent scattering. Specifically, we identify\nreactive scattering scenarios using incident wave packets of translational\nmotion where coherent control is operational and initial state entanglement is\nunnecessary. Both the stationary and time-dependent scenarios incorporate\nextended coherence features, making them physically distinct. From a\ntheoretical point of view, this work represents a large step forward in the\nqualitative understanding of coherently controlled reactive scattering. From an\nexperimental viewpoint, it offers an alternative to entanglement-based control\nschemes. However, both methods present significant challenges to existing\nexperimental technologies.\n",

Niikura et al., Nature (London) 421, 826\n(2003)] from a coherent control perspective. In this process, a strong laser\nfield incident on D2 ionizes an electron, accelerates the electron in the laser\nfield to eV energies, and then drives the electron to recollide with the parent\nion, causing D2+ dissociation. A number of results are demonstrated. First, a\nfull dimensional Strong Field Approximation (SFA) model is constructed and\nshown to be in agreement with the original experiment. This is then used to\nrigorously demonstrate that the experiment is an example of coherent pump-dump\ncontrol. Second, extensions to bichromatic coherent control are proposed by\nconsidering dissociative recollision of molecules prepared in a coherent\nsuperposition of vibrational states. Third, by comparing the results to similar\nscenarios involving field-free attosecond scattering of independently prepared\nD2+ and electron wave packets, recollision dissociation is shown to provide an\nexample of wave-packet coherent control of reactive scattering. Fourth, this\nanalysis makes clear that it is the temporal correlations between the continuum\nelectron and D2+ wave packet, and not entanglement, that are crucial for the\nsub-femtosecond probing resolution demonstrated in the experiment. This result\nclarifies some misconceptions regarding the importance of entanglement in the\nrecollision probing of D2+. Finally, signatures of entanglement between the\nrecollision electron and the atomic fragments, detectable via coincidence\nmeasurements, are identified.\n",

A superhelical\nstructure may be thought of as a helix whose axial centerline is not straight,\nbut also a helix. We examine the particular case where these two superimposed\nhelices have different handedness, and employ a combination of experimental,\nanalytic, and computational methods to determine the rotational velocity of\nsuperhelical bodies being towed through a very viscous fluid. We find that the\ndirection and rate of the rotation of the body is a result of competition\nbetween the two superimposed helices; for small axial helix amplitude, the body\ndynamics is controlled by the short-pitched helix, while there is a cross-over\nat larger amplitude to control by the axial helix.

        "abstract": "  Purcell's scallop theorem defines the type of motions of a solid body -\nreciprocal motions - which cannot propel the body in a viscous fluid with zero\nReynolds number. For example, the flapping of a wing is reciprocal and, as was\nrecently shown, can lead to directed motion only if its frequency Reynolds\nnumber, Re_f, is above a critical value of order one. Using elementary\nexamples, we show the existence of oscillatory reciprocal motions which are\neffective for all arbitrarily small values of the frequency Reynolds number and\ninduce net velocities scaling as (Re_f)^\\alpha (alpha > 0). This demonstrates a\ncontinuous breakdown of the scallop theorem with inertia.\n",

We solved the Laplace equation for this geometry and tested its\nsolution on true liquids and embryonic tissue fragments as well as\nmulticellular aggregates. The analytic solution provides the surface tension in\nterms of easily and accurately measurable geometric parameters. Experimental\nresults show that the various tissues and multicellular aggregates studied here\nare incompressible and, similarly to true liquids, possess effective surface\ntensions that are independent of the magnitude of the compressive force and the\nvolume of the droplet.\n",

Very little is known\nat present on how tissue level properties are related to cell and subcellular\nproperties. Modern measurement techniques provide quantitative results at both\nthe intracellular and tissue level, but not on the connection between these. In\nthe present work we outline a framework to address this connection. We\nspecifically concentrate on the morphogenetic process of tissue fusion, by\nfollowing the coalescence of two contiguous multicellular aggregates. The time\nevolution of this process can accurately be described by the theory of viscous\nliquids. We also study fusion by Monte Carlo simulations and a novel Cellular\nParticle Dynamics (CPD) model, which is similar to the earlier introduced\nSubcellular Element Model (Newman, 2005). Using the combination of experiments,\ntheory and modeling we are able to relate the measured tissue level biophysical\nquantities to subcellular parameters. Our approach has validity beyond the\nparticular morphogenetic process considered here and provides a general way to\nrelate biophysical properties across scales.\n",

When the gas flow is a\nmixture of different species, this proportionality can be exploited to extract\nthe contribution associated to the species from the spectral superposition\nacquired by a digital camera. This yields a method that simultaneously reveals\nspecies concentrations and mass density of the mixture. The procedure is\napplied to two under-expanded sonic jets discharged into a different gas\nambient - Helium into Argon and Argon into Helium - to measure the\nconcentration and density distribution along the jet axis and across it. A\ncomparison with experimental and numerical results obtained by other authors\nwhen observing under-expanded jets at different Mach numbers is made with the\ndensity distribution along the axis of the jet. This density distribution\nappears to be self-similar.\n",

Building on a recent work\nby H.Chen et al (2004), we account for fluctuations of a single -point\nprobability density in turbulence, by introducing a``two-level'' (${\\bf\nc,v}$)-phase-space, separating microscopic (${\\bf c'\\equiv c_{micro}= c-v}$)\nand hydrodynamic (${\\bf v'=v-V}$) modes. Unlike traditional kinetic theories,\nwith hydrodynamic approximations derived in terms of small deviations from\nthermodynamic equilibrium, the theory developed in this work, is based on a\nfar- from -equilibrium isotropic and homogeneous turbulence as an unperturbed\nstate. The expansion in dimensionless rate of strain leads to a new class of\nturbulent models, including the well-known ${\\cal K}-{\\cal E}$, Reynolds stress\nand all possible nonlinear models. The role of interaction of the fluxes in\nphysical space with the energy flux across the scales, not present in standard\nmodeling, is demonstrated on example of turbulent channel flow. To close the\nsystem, neither equation for turbulent kinetic energy nor information on\npressure-velocity correlations, contained in the derived coarse-grained kinetic\nequation, are needed.\n",

It is shown that random\nadvection and stretching by turbulence leads to formation of scalar-enriched\nsheets of {\\it strongly fluctuating thickness} $\\eta_{c}$. The molecular-level\nmixing is achieved by diffusion across these sheets (interfaces) separating the\nreactants. Since diffusion time scale is $\\tau_{d}\\propto \\eta_{c}^{2}$, the\nknowledge of probability density $Q(\\eta_{c},Re)$ is crucial for evaluation of\nchemical reaction rates. In this paper we derive the probability density\n$Q(\\eta_{c},Re,Sc)$ and predict a transition in the reaction rate behavior from\n${\\cal R}\\propto \\sqrt{Re}$ ($Re\\leq 10^{4}$) to the high-Re asymptotics ${\\cal\nR}\\propto Re^{0}$. The theory leads to an approximate universality of\ntransitional Reynolds number $Re_{tr}\\approx 10^{4}$. It is also shown that if\nchemical reaction involves short-lived reactants, very strong anomalous\nfluctuations of the length-scale $\\eta_{c}$ may lead to non-negligibly small\nreaction rates.\n",

Energy transfer, mediated by surface plasmons, from donor molecules\nto acceptor molecules over ten micrometer distances is demonstrated. Also\nsurface plasmon coupled emission from the donor molecules is observed at\nsimilar distances away from the excitation spot. The lithographic fabrication\nmethod we use for positioning the dye molecules allows scaling to nanometer\ndimensions. The use of molecules as couplers between far-field and near-field\nlight offers the advantages that no special excitation geometry is needed, any\nlight source can be used to excite plasmons and the excitation can be localized\nbelow the diffraction limit. Moreover, the use of molecules has the potential\nfor integration with molecular electronics and for the use of molecular\nself-assembly in fabrication. Our results constitute a proof-of-principle\ndemonstration of a plasmonic waveguide where signal in- and outcoupling is done\nby molecules.\n",

The results are presented both as functions\nof the Rayleigh number (Ra) up to $10^8$ (for fixed temperature difference\nbetween the top and bottom plates) and as functions of\n\"non-Oberbeck-Boussinesqness'' or \"NOBness'' ($\\Delta$) up to 50 K (for fixed\nRa). For this large NOBness the center temperature $T_c$ is more than 5 K\nlarger than the arithmetic mean temperature $T_m$ between top and bottom plate\nand only weakly depends on Ra. To physically account for the NOB deviations of\nthe Nusselt numbers from its Oberbeck-Boussinesq values, we apply the\ndecomposition of $Nu_{NOB}/Nu_{OB}$ into the product of two effects, namely\nfirst the change in the sum of the top and bottom thermal BL thicknesses, and\nsecond the shift of the center temperature $T_c$ as compared to $T_m$. While\nfor water the origin of the $Nu$ deviation is totally dominated by the second\neffect (cf. Ahlers et al., J. Fluid Mech. 569, pp. 409 (2006)) for glycerol the\nfirst effect is dominating, in spite of the large increase of $T_c$ as compared\nto $T_m$.\n",

The force evaluation of the $N$-body problem is\nimplemented in ``Compute Unified Device Architecture'' (CUDA) using the GPU to\nspeed-up the calculations. We tested the implementation on three different\n$N$-body codes: two direct $N$-body integration codes, using the 4th order\npredictor-corrector Hermite integrator with block time-steps, and one\nBarnes-Hut treecode, which uses a 2nd order leapfrog integration scheme. The\nintegration of the equations of motions for all codes is performed on the host\nCPU.\n  We find that for $N > 512$ particles the GPU outperforms the GRAPE-6Af, if\nsome softening in the force calculation is accepted. Without softening and for\nvery small integration time steps the GRAPE still outperforms the GPU. We\nconclude that modern GPUs offer an attractive alternative to GRAPE-6Af special\npurpose hardware. Using the same time-step criterion, the total energy of the\n$N$-body system was conserved better than to one in $10^6$ on the GPU, only\nabout an order of magnitude worse than obtained with GRAPE-6Af. For $N \\apgt\n10^5$ the 8800GTX outperforms the host CPU by a factor of about 100 and runs at\nabout the same speed as the GRAPE-6Af.\n",

        "abstract": "  It has been suggested that magnetic fields play a dynamically-important role\nin core-collapse explosions of massive stars. In particular, they may be\nimportant in the collapsar scenario for gamma-ray bursts (GRB), where the\ncentral engine is a hyper-accreting black hole or a millisecond magnetar. The\npresent paper is focussed on the magnetar scenario, with a specific emphasis on\nthe interaction of the magnetar magnetosphere with the infalling stellar\nenvelope. First, the ``Pulsar-in-a-Cavity'' problem is introduced as a paradigm\nfor a magnetar inside a collapsing star. The basic set-up of this fundamental\nplasma-physics problem is described, outlining its main features, and simple\nestimates are derived for the evolution of the magnetic field. In the context\nof a collapsing star, it is proposed that, at first, the ram pressure of the\ninfalling plasma acts to confine the magnetosphere, enabling a gradual build-up\nof the magnetic pressure. At some point, the growing magnetic pressure\novertakes the (decreasing) ram pressure of the gas, resulting in a\nmagnetically-driven explosion. The explosion should be highly anisotropic, as\nthe hoop-stress of the toroidal field, confined by the surrounding stellar\nmatter, collimates the magnetically-dominated outflow into two beamed\nmagnetic-tower jets. This creates a clean narrow channel for the escape of\nenergy from the central engine through the star, as required for GRBs. In\naddition, the delayed onset of the collimated-explosion phase can explain the\nproduction of large quantities of Nickel-56, as suggested by the GRB-Supernova\nconnection. Finally, the prospects for numerical simulations of this scenario\nare discussed.\n",

        "abstract": "  We present a new version of a dynamical spectral model for Large Eddy\nSimulation based on the Eddy Damped Quasi Normal Markovian approximation\n\\cite{sao,chollet_lesieur}. Three distinct modifications are implemented and\ntested. On the one hand, whereas in current approaches, a Kolmogorov-like\nenergy spectrum is usually assumed in order to evaluate the nonlocal transfer,\nin our method the energy spectrum of the subgrid scales adapts itself\ndynamically to the large-scale resolved spectrum; this first modification\nallows in particular for a better treatment of transient phases and\ninstabilities, as shown on one specific example. Moreover, the model takes into\naccount the phase relationships of the small-scales, embodied for example in\nstrong localized structures such as vortex filaments. To that effect, phase\ninformation is implemented in the treatment of the so-called eddy noise in the\nclosure model. Finally, we also consider the role that helical small scales may\nplay in the evaluation of the transfer of energy and helicity, the two\ninvariants of the primitive equations in the inviscid case; this leads as well\nto intrinsic variations in the development of helicity spectra. Therefore, our\nmodel allows for simulations of flows for a variety of circumstances and a\npriori at any given Reynolds number. Comparisons with Direct Numerical\nSimulations of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation are performed on\nfluids driven by an ABC (Beltrami) flow which is a prototype of fully helical\nflows. Good agreements are obtained for physical and spectral behavior of the\nlarge scales.\n",

The general situation of an arbitrary number of states\nand arbitrary number of nuclear degrees of freedom (modes) is considered. The\nmacrosystem is decomposed into a system part carrying a few, strongly coupled\nmodes, and an environment, comprising the vast number of remaining modes. By\nsuccessively transforming the modes of the environment, a hierarchy of\neffective Hamiltonians for the environment is constructed. Each effective\nHamiltonian depends on a reduced number of effective modes, which carry\ncumulative effects. By considering the system's Hamiltonian along with a few\nmembers of the hierarchy, it is shown mathematically by a moment analysis that\nthe quantum dynamics of the entire macrosystem can be numerically exactly\ncomputed on a given time-scale. The time scale wanted defines the number of\neffective Hamiltonians to be included. The contribution of the environment to\nthe quantum dynamics of the macrosystem translates into a sequential coupling\nof effective modes. The wavefunction of the macrosystem is known in the full\nspace of modes, allowing for the evaluation of observables such as the\ntime-dependent individual excitation along modes of interest, as well a spectra\nand electronic-population dynamics.\n",

The\ncurrent sheet can be stable or unstable if the multiplication of two magnetic\ngradients is positive or negative. In the stable region, the kink-like wave\nmode is interpreted as so called flapping waves observed in the Earth's\nmagnetotail current sheet. The kink wave group velocity estimated for the\nEarth's current sheet is of the order of a few tens kilometers per second. This\nis in good agreement with the observations of the flapping motions of the\nmagnetotail current sheet.\n",

        "abstract": "  Quantum-dynamical full-dimensional (15D) calculations are reported for the\nprotonated water dimer (H5O2+) using the multiconfiguration time-dependent\nHartree (MCTDH) method. The dynamics is described by curvilinear coordinates.\nThe expression of the kinetic energy operator in this set of coordinates is\ngiven and its derivation, following the polyspherical method, is discussed. The\nPES employed is that of Huang et al. [JCP, 122, 044308, (2005)]. A scheme for\nthe representation of the potential energy surface (PES) is discussed which is\nbased on a high dimensional model representation scheme (cut-HDMR), but\nmodified to take advantage of the mode-combination representation of the\nvibrational wavefunction used in MCTDH. The convergence of the PES expansion\nused is quantified and evidence is provided that it correctly reproduces the\nreference PES at least for the range of energies of interest. The reported zero\npoint energy of the system is converged with respect to the MCTDH expansion and\nin excellent agreement (16.7 cm-1 below) with the diffusion Monte Carlo result\non the PES of Huang et al. The highly fluxional nature of the cation is\naccounted for through use of curvilinear coordinates. The system is found to\ninterconvert between equivalent minima through wagging and internal rotation\nmotions already when in the ground vibrational-state, i.e., T=0. It is shown\nthat a converged quantum-dynamical description of such a flexible, multi-minima\nsystem is possible.\n",

This theory would be\nexact for models of liquid water in which the intermolecular interactions\nvanish outside a finite spatial range, and therefore provides a precise\nanalysis tool for investigating the effects of longer-ranged intermolecular\ninteractions. We show how local order can be introduced through quasi-chemical\ntheory. Long-ranged interactions are characterized generally by a conditional\ndistribution of binding energies, and this formulation is interpreted as a\nregularization of the primitive statistical thermodynamic problem. These\nbinding-energy distributions for liquid water are observed to be unimodal. The\ngaussian approximation proposed is remarkably successful in predicting the\nGibbs free energy and the molar entropy of liquid water, as judged by\ncomparison with numerically exact results. The remaining discrepancies are\nsubtle quantitative problems that do have significant consequences for the\nthermodynamic properties that distinguish water from many other liquids. The\nbasic subtlety of liquid water is found then in the competition of several\neffects which must be quantitatively balanced for realistic results.\n",

The basic idea is to integrate models for nonmotorized vehicles\n(nm-vehicles) with models for motorized vehicles (m-vehicles). Based on the\nidea, a model for mix traffic flow is realized in in the following two steps.\nAt a first step, the models that can be integrated should be chosen. The famous\nNaSch cellular automata (NCA) model for m-vehicles and the Burgur cellular\nautomata (BCA) model for nm-vehicles are used in this paper, since the two\nmodels are similar and comparable. At a second step, we should study coupling\nrules between m-vehicles and nm-vehicles to represent their interaction.\nSpecial lane changing rules are designed for the coupling process. The proposed\nmodel is named as the combined cellular automata (CCA) model. The model is\napplied to a typical mixed traffic scenario, where a bus stop without special\nstop bay is set on nonmotorized lanes. The simulation results show that the\nmodel can describe both the interaction between the flow of nm-vehicles and\nm-vehicles and their characters.\n",

This\ntransition takes place when the Sweet--Parker layer becomes thinner than the\ncharacteristic collisionless reconnection scale. I present a simple criterion\nfor this transition in terms of the upstream plasma density (n_e), the\nreconnecting (B_0) and guide (B_z) magnetic field components, and the global\nlength (L) of the reconnection layer: L < 6.10^9 cm [n_e/(10^{10}/cm^3)]^(-3)\n(B_0/30G)^4 (B_0/B_z)^2. Next, coronal energy release by reconnection raises\nthe ambient plasma density via chromospheric evaporation and this, in turn,\ntemporarily inhibits subsequent reconnection involving the newly-reconnected\nloops. Over time, however, radiative cooling gradually lowers the density again\nbelow the critical value and fast reconnection again becomes possible. As a\nresult, the density is highly inhomogeneous and intermittent but,\nstatistically, does not deviate strongly from the critical value which is\ncomparable with the observed coronal density. Thus, in the long run, the\ncoronal heating process can be represented by repeating cycles that consist of\nfast reconnection events (i.e., nanoflares), followed by rapid evaporation\nepisodes, followed by relatively long periods (1-hour) during which magnetic\nstresses build up and simultaneously the plasma cools down and precipitates.\n",

        "abstract": "  This review is focused on the borderline region of theoretical physics and\nmathematics. First, we describe numerical methods for the acceleration of the\nconvergence of series. These provide a useful toolbox for theoretical physics\nwhich has hitherto not received the attention it actually deserves. The\nunifying concept for convergence acceleration methods is that in many cases,\none can reach much faster convergence than by adding a particular series term\nby term. In some cases, it is even possible to use a divergent input series,\ntogether with a suitable sequence transformation, for the construction of\nnumerical methods that can be applied to the calculation of special functions.\nThis review both aims to provide some practical guidance as well as a\ngroundwork for the study of specialized literature. As a second topic, we\nreview some recent developments in the field of Borel resummation, which is\ngenerally recognized as one of the most versatile methods for the summation of\nfactorially divergent (perturbation) series. Here, the focus is on algorithms\nwhich make optimal use of all information contained in a finite set of\nperturbative coefficients. The unifying concept for the various aspects of the\nBorel method investigated here is given by the singularities of the Borel\ntransform, which introduce ambiguities from a mathematical point of view and\nlead to different possible physical interpretations. The two most important\ncases are: (i) the residues at the singularities correspond to the decay width\nof a resonance, and (ii) the presence of the singularities indicates the\nexistence of nonperturbative contributions which cannot be accounted for on the\nbasis of a Borel resummation and require generalizations toward resurgent\nexpansions. Both of these cases are illustrated by examples.\n",

        "abstract": "  We calculate the electron-ion temperature equilibration rate in a fully\nionized, weakly to moderately coupled plasma, using an exact treatment of the\nFermi-Dirac electrons. The temperature is sufficiently high so that the\nquantum-mechanical Born approximation to the scattering is valid. At the heart\nof this calculation lies the method of dimensional continuation, a technique\nthat we borrow from quantum field theory and use in a novel fashion to regulate\nthe kinetic equations in a consistent manner. We can then perform a systematic\nperturbation expansion and thereby obtain a finite first-principles result to\nleading and next-to-leading order. Unlike model building, this systematic\ncalculation yields an estimate of its own error and thus prescribes its domain\nof applicability. The calculational error is small for a weakly to moderately\ncoupled plasma, for which our result is nearly exact. It should also be\nemphasized that our calculation becomes unreliable for a strongly coupled\nplasma, where the perturbative expansion that we employ breaks down, and one\nmust then utilize model building and computer simulations. Besides providing\nnew and potentially useful results, we use this calculation as an opportunity\nto explain the method of dimensional continuation in a pedagogical fashion.\nInterestingly, in the regime of relevance for many inertial confinement fusion\nexperiments, the degeneracy corrections are comparable in size to the\nsubleading quantum correction below the Born approximation. For consistency, we\ntherefore present this subleading quantum-to-classical transition correction in\naddition to the degeneracy correction.\n",

        "abstract": "  It is pointed out that the three established adiabatic invariants are\nseparating invariants in the sense of Liouville. It is widely claimed that no\nmore than three adiabatic invariants can exist for the motion of a point\ncharge. However, additional independent (not separating) adiabatic invariants\ndo exist. For a force free motion, the components of angular momentum provide\ntwo additional constants of motion. This result can be generalized to the\nHamilton Jacobi equation. The number of independent constants of motion is\nreduced if there is a global symmetry. For a gyrating particle, neglecting a\ngyro helix type of invariant, four 'useful' invariants could exist. A radial\ndrift invariant, corresponding to the average of the radial coordinate of the\nparticle, is a constant of motion for a confined gyrating particle. For the\nspecial case of a screw pinch where each gyro center moves on a magnetic flux\nsurface without mirror trapping, the radial drift invariant is the radial\ncoordinate of the gyro center. For a screw pinch, the set of constants of\nmotion consising of the energy, parallel velocity and radial drift invariant is\nconvenient to model the equilibrium. Local Maxwellian distribution functions\nexpressed in this set of invariants are demonstrated to provide MHD-type of\nequilibria, for which it is straightforward to model the radial profiles of the\nparticle and field components.\n",

The peculiarity and interest of exciting these\nelectron fishbones by ECRH only or by LH only is also analyzed. Not only the\nmode stability is explained, but also the transition between steady state\nnonlinear oscillations to bursting (almost regular) pulsations, as observed in\nFTU, is interpreted in terms of the LH power input. These results are directly\nrelevant to the investigation of trapped alpha particle interactions with\nlow-frequency MHD modes in burning plasmas: in fact, alpha particles in reactor\nrelevant conditions are characterized by small dimensionless orbits, similarly\nto electrons; the trapped particle bounce averaged dynamics, meanwhile, depends\non energy and not mass.\n",

We used density\nfunctional theory (DFT) to obtain the ground-state optimised geometries, and\ntime-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) to evaluate the electronic absorption spectra.\nTotal-energy differences enabled us to evaluate the electron affinities and\nfirst and second ionisation energies, the quasiparticle correction to the\nHOMO-LUMO energy gap and an estimate of the excitonic effects in the neutral\nmolecules. Electronic absorption spectra have been computed by combining two\ndifferent implementations of TD-DFT: the frequency-space method to study\ngeneral trends as a function of charge-state and molecular size for the\nlowest-lying in-plane long-polarised and short-polarised $\\pi\\to\\pi^\\star$\nelectronic transitions, and the real-time propagation scheme to obtain the\nwhole photo-absorption cross-section up to the far-UV. Doubly-ionised PAHs are\nfound to display strong electronic transitions of $\\pi\\to\\pi^\\star$ character\nin the near-IR, visible, and near-UV spectral ranges, like their singly-charged\ncounterparts. While, as expected, the broad plasmon-like structure with its\nmaximum at about 17-18 eV is relatively insensitive to the charge-state of the\nmolecule, a systematic decrease with increasing positive charge of the\nabsorption cross-section between about 6 and about 12 eV is observed for each\nmember of the class.\n",

        "abstract": "  The magmatic and metamorphic zircons were investigated with Raman spectrum\nmicroprobe analysis. We found notable differences between these two kinds of\nzircons exhibited by the variation trend of Raman peak intensity from core to\nrim of a crystal. In magmatic zircons, the intensity and the ratio H/W of Raman\nspectrum peaks gradually decrease from core to rim of a crystal, which is\nproduced by an increase in metamictization degree and suggests an increase in U\nand Th concentrations from core to rim. In metamorphic zircons, there are two\nkinds of crystals according to their Raman spectra: the first group of zircons\nexhibits a variation trend opposite to those of magmatic zircons, tending to\nincrease in the Raman peak intensity and H/W value from core to rim of a\ncrystal, which is produced by a decrease in metamictization degree and\nindicates a decrease of U and Th concentrations from core to rim of a crystal.\nThe second group of zircons exhibits no change in Raman peak intensity and H/W\nvalue through a crystal. The data of infrared and Raman spectra of these\ncrystals show that they are well crystallized and have no lattice destruction\ninduced by metamictization, and are thought to crystallize in high temperature\nstages of metamorphism. During these stages, the U and Th ions have been\nremoved by metamorphic fluids from the parent rocks of these zircons. The other\ndifference between magmatic and metamorphic zircons is the background level of\ntheir Raman spectra, which is high and sloped in magmatic zircons, but low and\nhorizontal in metamorphic zircons. The differences between magmatic and\nmetamorphic zircons can be used to identify the genesis of zircons and\nunderstand the origin and evolution history of their parent rocks.\n",

        "abstract": "  Most large scale dynamo research for astrophysical rotators focuses on\ninterior flow driven helical dynamos (FDHDs), but larger scale coronal fields\nmost directly influence observations. It is thus important to understand the\nrelationship between coronal and interior fields. Coronal field relaxation is\nactually a type of magnetically dominated helical dynamo (MDHD). MDHDs also\noccur in fusion plasma devices where they drive a system toward its relaxed\nstate in response to magnetic helicity injection that otherwise drives the\nsystem away from this state. Global scale fields of astrophysical rotators and\njets are thus plausibly produced by a direct coupling between an interior FDHD\nand a coronal MDHD, interfaced by magnetic helicity transport through their\nmutual boundary. Tracking the magnetic helicity also elucidates how both FDHD\nand MDHDs evolve and saturate. The utility of magnetic helicity is unhampered\nby its non-gauge invariance since physical fields can always be recovered.\n",

This is accomplished by dynamically\nswitching off the excitation laser when a quantum-jump of the molecule to the\ntriplet state is optically detected. This procedure leads to a lengthened\nsingle-molecule observation time and an increased total number of detected\nphotons. The resulting improvement in photostability unambiguously confirms the\nimportance of photoexcitation from the triplet state in photobleaching\ndynamics, and may allow the investigation of new phenomena at the\nsingle-molecule level.\n",

We first\npresent a full account for the quantum solvation effect on the electron\ntransfer in Debye solvents, addressed previously in J. Theore. & Comput. Chem.\n{\\bf 5}, 685 (2006). Distinct reaction mechanisms, including the quantum\nsolvation-induced transitions from barrier-crossing to tunneling, and from\nbarrierless to quantum barrier-crossing rate processes, are shown in the fast\nmodulation or low viscosity regime. This regime is also found in favor of\nnonadiabatic rate processes. We further propose to use Kubo's motional\nnarrowing line shape function to describe the Markovian character of the\nreaction. It is found that a non-Markovian rate process is most likely to occur\nin a symmetric system in the fast modulation regime, where the electron\ntransfer is dominant by tunneling due to the Fermi resonance.\n",

        "abstract": "  We relax the usual diagonal constraint on the matrix representation of the\neigenvalue wave equation by allowing it to be tridiagonal. This results in a\nlarger solution space that incorporates an exact analytic solution for the\nnon-central electric dipole potential cos(theta)/r^2, which was known not to\nbelong to the class of exactly solvable potentials. As a result, we were able\nto obtain an exact analytic solution of the three-dimensional time-independent\nSchrodinger equation for a charged particle in the field of a point electric\ndipole that could carry a nonzero net charge. This problem models the\ninteraction of an electron with a molecule (neutral or ionized) that has a\npermanent electric dipole moment. The solution is written as a series of square\nintegrable functions that support a tridiagonal matrix representation for the\nangular and radial components of the wave operator. Moreover, this solution is\nfor all energies, the discrete (for bound states) as well as the continuous\n(for scattering states). The expansion coefficients of the radial and angular\ncomponents of the wavefunction are written in terms of orthogonal polynomials\nsatisfying three-term recursion relations. For the Coulomb-free case, where the\nmolecule is neutral, we calculate critical values for its dipole moment below\nwhich no electron capture is allowed. These critical values are obtained not\nonly for the ground state, where it agrees with already known results, but also\nfor excited states as well.\n",

In a burning plasma\nmachine design like the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor\n(ITER), dust contamination presents problems for diagnostic integration and may\ncontribute to tritium safety issues. Additionally due to ITER design, such dust\ncontamination problems are projected to become of even greater concern due to\ndust/wall interactions and possible instabilities created within the plasma by\nsuch particulates. Since the dynamics of such dust can in general be explained\nemploying a combination of the ion drag, Coulomb force, and ion pre-sheath\ndrifts, recent research in complex (dusty) plasma physics often offers unique\ninsights for this research area. This paper will discuss the possibility of how\nexperimental observations of the dust and plasma parameters within a GEC rf\nReference Cell might be employed to diagnose conditions within fusion reactors,\nhopefully providing insight into possible mechanisms for dust detection and\nremoval.\n",

We find irregular patterns for a number of\ntransitions with in $n$-complexes with $n\\le4$. We have used the exisiting\nvalues of the allowed electric dipole ($E1$) transition as a benchmark of our\ntheory. Good agreement with the existing values establish accuracies of not\nonly the theoretical method but the basis function as well. In general the\nelectric quadrupole ($E2$) transition probabilities are greater in magnitude\nthan magnetic dipole ($M1$) transition probabilities, whereas for medium atomic\ntransition frequencies they are of the same order of magnitude. On the other\nhand if the transitions involved are between two fine structure components of\nthe same term, then the $M1$ transition probability is more probable than that\nof $E2$. We have analyzed these trends with physical arguments and order of\nmagnitude estimations. The results presented here in tabular and graphical\nforms are compared with the available theoretical and observed data. Graphical\nanalysis helps to understand the trends of electric and magnetic transitions\nfor the decay channels presented here. Our calculated values of the lifetimes\nof the excited states are in very good agreement with the available results.\n",

We\nexplore the role of resonance sticking in the scattered disk, a phenomenon\ncharacterized by multiple temporary resonance captures ('resonances' refers to\nexternal mean motion resonances with Neptune, which can be described in the\nform r:s, where the arguments r and s are integers). First, all scattered TNOs\nevolve through intermittent temporary resonance capture events and\ngravitational scattering by Neptune. Each scattered TNO experiences tens to\nhundreds of resonance captures over a period of 4 Gyr, which represents about\n38% of the object's lifetime (mean value). Second, resonance sticking plays an\nimportant role at semimajor axes a < 250 AU, where the great majority of such\ncaptures occurred. It is noteworthy that the stickiest (i.e., dominant)\nresonances in the scattered disk are located within this distance range and are\nthose possessing the lowest argument s. This was evinced by r:1, r:2 and r:3\nresonances, which played the greatest role during resonance sticking evolution,\noften leading to captures in several of their neighboring resonances. Finally,\nthe timescales and likelihood of temporary resonance captures are roughly\nproportional to resonance strength. The dominance of low s resonances is also\nrelated to the latter. In sum, resonance sticking has an important impact on\nthe evolution of scattered TNOs, contributing significantly to the longevity of\nthese objects.\n",

Four\nimportant issues in the construction of a well-balanced scheme for gas dynamic\nequations are addressed. First, the inclusion of the gravitational source term\ninto the flux function is necessary. Second, to achieve second-order accuracy\nof a well-balanced scheme, the Chapman-Enskog expansion of the Boltzmann\nequation with the inclusion of the external force term is used. Third, to avoid\nartificial heating in an isolated system under a gravitational field, the\nsource term treatment inside each cell has to be evaluated consistently with\nthe flux evaluation at the cell interface. Fourth, the multidimensional\napproach with the inclusion of tangential gradients in two-dimensional and\nthree-dimensional cases becomes important in order to maintain the accuracy of\nthe scheme. Many numerical examples are used to validate the above issues,\nwhich include the comparison between the solutions from the current scheme and\nthe Strang splitting method. The methodology developed in this paper can also\nbe applied to other systems, such as semi-conductor device simulations under\nelectric fields.\n",

        "abstract": "  In this paper, we develop a structure-preserving discretization of the\nLagrangian framework for electromagnetism, combining techniques from\nvariational integrators and discrete differential forms. This leads to a\ngeneral family of variational, multisymplectic numerical methods for solving\nMaxwell's equations that automatically preserve key symmetries and invariants.\n  In doing so, we demonstrate several new results, which apply both to some\nwell-established numerical methods and to new methods introduced here. First,\nwe show that Yee's finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) scheme, along with a\nnumber of related methods, are multisymplectic and derive from a discrete\nLagrangian variational principle. Second, we generalize the Yee scheme to\nunstructured meshes, not just in space but in 4-dimensional spacetime. This\nrelaxes the need to take uniform time steps, or even to have a preferred time\ncoordinate at all. Finally, as an example of the type of methods that can be\ndeveloped within this general framework, we introduce a new asynchronous\nvariational integrator (AVI) for solving Maxwell's equations. These results are\nillustrated with some prototype simulations that show excellent energy and\nconservation behavior and lack of spurious modes, even for an irregular mesh\nwith asynchronous time stepping.\n",

Our numerical results illustrate that\na dramatic improvement in accuracy may be obtained in this way.

Typical magnetic fields B~10^12 G in neutron star envelopes do not\naffect this conductivity although they strongly reduce the electron thermal\nconductivity across the magnetic field. The ion thermal conductivity remains\nmuch smaller than the electron conductivity along the magnetic field. However,\nin the outer neutron star envelope it can be larger than the electron\nconductivity across the field, that is important for heat transport across\nmagnetic field lines in cooling neutron stars.

The results are based on a detailed analysis of three-dimensional\nnumerical flows at moderate Reynold numbers. The energy transfer functions, as\nwell as the global and partial fluxes, are examined by means of different\ngeometrical wavenumber shells. On the one hand, the transfer functions of the\ntwo conserved Els\\\"asser energies $E^+$ and $E^-$ are found local in both the\ndirections parallel ($k_\\|$-direction) and perpendicular ($k_\\perp$-direction)\nto the magnetic guide-field, whatever the ${\\bf B}$-strength. On the other\nhand, from the flux analysis, the interactions between the two\ncounterpropagating Els\\\"asser waves become nonlocal. Indeed, as the ${\\bf\nB}$-intensity is increased, local interactions are strongly decreased and the\ninteractions with small $k_\\|$ modes dominate the cascade. Most of the energy\nflux in the $k_\\perp$-direction is due to modes in the plane at $k_\\|=0$, while\nthe weaker cascade in the $k_\\|$-direction is due to the modes with $k_\\|=1$.\nThe stronger magnetized flows tends thus to get closer to the weak turbulence\nlimit where the three-wave resonant interactions are dominating. Hence, the\ntransition from the strong to the weak turbulence regime occurs by reducing the\nnumber of effective modes in the energy cascade.\n",

In the present paper, we\npropose a network model obtained as a consequence of interactions between two\nspecies (e.g. predator and prey). Fields are produced and sensed by the\nindividuals, defining spatio-temporal patterns which are strongly affected by\nthe attraction intensity between individuals from the same species. The\ndynamical evolution of the system, including the change of individuals between\ndifferent clusters, is investigated by building two complex networks having the\nindividuals as nodes. In the first network, the edge weight is given by the\nEuclidean distance between every two individuals and, in the case of the second\nnetwork, by the amount of time two individuals stay close one another. A third\nnetwork is obtained from the two previous networks whose nodes correspond to\nthe spatially congruent groups. The system evolves to an organized state where\nGaussian and scale-free-like strength distributions emerge, respectively, in\nthe predator and prey networks. Such a different connectivity is mainly a\nconsequence of preys elimination. Some configurations favor the survival of\npreys or higher efficiency of predator activity.\n",

Most previous perturbative methods give incorrect results for\nthis case, even to lowest order, because of the complicated discontinuous\nboundary conditions on the electric field at such an interface. Our final\nexpression is simply a surface integral, over the material interface, of the\ncontinuous field components from the unperturbed structure. The derivation is\nbased on a \"localized\" coordinate-transformation technique, which avoids both\nthe problem of field discontinuities and the challenge of constructing an\nexplicit coordinate transformation by taking a limit in which a coordinate\nperturbation is infinitesimally localized around the boundary. Not only is our\nresult potentially useful in evaluating boundary perturbations, e.g. from\nfabrication imperfections, in highly anisotropic media such as many\nmetamaterials, but it also has a direct application in numerical\nelectromagnetism. In particular, we show how it leads to a sub-pixel smoothing\nscheme to ameliorate staircasing effects in discretized simulations of\nanisotropic media, in such a way as to greatly reduce the numerical errors\ncompared to other proposed smoothing schemes.\n",

        "abstract": "  Two cases of weakly and strongly stressed X-point collapse were considered.\nHere descriptors weakly and strongly refer to 20 % and 124 % unidirectional\nspatial compression of the X-point, respectively. In the weakly stressed case,\nthe reconnection rate, defined as the out-of-plane electric field in the\nX-point (the magnetic null) normalised by the product of external magnetic\nfield and Alfv\\'en speeds, peaks at 0.11, with its average over 1.25 Alfv\\'en\ntimes being 0.04. Electron energy distribution in the current sheet, at the\nhigh energy end of the spectrum, shows a power law distribution with the index\nvarying in time, attaining a maximal value of -4.1 at the final simulation time\nstep (1.25 Alfv\\'en times). In the strongly stressed case, magnetic\nreconnection peak occurs 3.4 times faster and is more efficient. The peak\nreconnection rate now attains value 2.5, with the average reconnection rate\nover 1.25 Alfv\\'en times being 0.5. The power law energy spectrum for the\nelectrons in the current sheet attains now a steeper index of -5.5, a value\nclose to the ones observed in the vicinity of X-type region in the Earth's\nmagneto-tail. Within about one Alfv\\'en time, 2% and 20% of the initial\nmagnteic energy is converted into heat and accelerated particle energy in the\ncase of weak and strong stress, respectively. In the both cases, during the\npeak of the reconnection, the quadruple out-of-plane magnetic field is\ngenerated, hinting possibly to the Hall regime of the reconnection. These\nresults strongly suggest the importance of the collionless, stressed X-point\ncollapse as a possible contributing factor to the solution of the solar coronal\nheating problem or more generally, as an efficient mechanism of converting\nmagnetic energy into heat and super-thermal particle energy.\n",

        "abstract": "  Bunches of streamers form the early stages of sparks and lightning but theory\npresently concentrates on single streamers or on coarse approximations of whole\nbreakdown trees. Here a periodic array of interacting streamer discharges in a\nstrong homogeneous electric field is studied in PDE approximation in two\ndimensions. If the period of the streamer array is small enough, the streamers\ndo not branch, but approach uniform translation. When the streamers are close\nto the branching regime, the enhanced field at the tip of the streamer is close\nto $2 E_{\\infty}$, where $E_{\\infty}$ is the homogeneous field applied between\nthe electrodes. We discuss a moving boundary approximation to the set of PDEs.\nThis moving boundary model turns out to be essentially the same as the one for\ntwo-fluid Hele-Shaw flows. In two dimensions, this model possesses a known\nanalytical solution. The shape of the 2D interacting streamers in uniform\nmotion obtained from the PDE simulations is actually well fitted by the\nanalytically known ``selected Saffman-Taylor finger''. This finding helps to\nunderstand streamer interactions and raises new questions on the general theory\nof finger selection in moving boundary problems.\n",

        "abstract": "  We examine the electronic ground state of acenes with different number of\nfused benzene rings (up to 40) by using first principles density functional\ntheory. Their properties are compared with those of infinite polyacene. We find\nthat the ground state of acenes that consist of more than seven fused benzene\nrings is an antiferromagnetic (in other words, open-shell singlet) state, and\nwe show that this singlet is not necessarily a diradical, because the spatially\nseparated magnetizations for the spin-up and spin-down electrons increase with\nthe size of the acene. For example, our results indicate that there are about\nfour spin-up electrons localized at one zigzag edge of 20-acene. The reason\nthat both acenes and polyacene have the antiferromagnetic ground state is due\nto the zigzag-shaped boundaries, which cause pi-electrons to localize and form\nspin orders at the edges. Both wider graphene ribbons and large\nrectangular-shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have been shown to share\nthis antiferromagnetic ground state. Therefore, we demonstrate that the\npi-electronic structure of higher acenes and ployacene are still dictated by\nthe zigzag edges, and our results provide a consistent description of their\nelectronic ground state.\n",

In the case of the linearly polarized\nincident pulse, there harmonic generation occurs, that is absent in the case of\nthe circular polarization. The spectra of the reflected pulses for different\ninitial forms and amplitudes are studied.\n",

        "abstract": "  It is shown that the physical interpretation of Elie Cartan three-dimensional\nspace torsion as couple asymmetric stress, has the effect of damping,\npreviously Riemannian unstable Couette planar shear flow, leading to stability\nof the flow in the Lagrangean sense. Actually, since the flow speed is\ninversely proportional to torsion, it has the effect of causing a damping in\nthe planar flow atenuating the instability effect. In this sense we may say\nthat Cartan torsion induces shear viscous asymmetric stresses in the fluid,\nwhich are able to damp the instability of the flow. The stability of the flow\nis computed from the sectional curvature in non-Riemannian three-dimensional\nmanifold. Marginal stability is asssumed by making the sectional non-Riemannian\ncurvature zero, which allows us to determine the speeds of flows able to induce\nthis stability. The ideas discussed here show that torsion plays the\ngeometrical role of magnetic field in hydromagnetic instability of Couette\nflows recently investigated by Bonnano and Urpin (PRE, (2007,in press) can be\nextended and applied to plastic flows with microstructure defects. Recently\nRiemannian asymmetric stresses in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) have been\nconsidered by Billig (2004).\n",

These phenomena are related to different physical objects and are\nusually studied within the context of different, sometimes rather\nsophisticated, physical approaches. Remarkably, all these seemingly unrelated\nphenomena owe their origin to the same underlying physical mechanism - wave\ninteraction with an open resonator. Here we show that it is possible to\ndescribe all of these effects in a unified way, mapping each system onto a\nsimple resonator model. Such description provides a thorough understanding of\nthe phenomena, explains all the main features of their complex behaviour, and\nenables to control the system via the resonator parameters: eigenfrequencies,\nQ-factors, and coupling coefficients.\n",

The effects of\nthe ion dynamics following the charge-displacement self-channeling of the laser\npulse have been addressed. Radial ion acceleration leads to the ``breaking'' of\nthe plasma channel walls, causing an inversion of the radial space-charge field\nand the filamentation of the laser pulse. At later times a number of\nlong-lived, quasi-periodic field structures are observed and their dynamics is\ncharacterized with high resolution.

        "abstract": "  In the laser wakefield accelerator (LWFA) a short intense laser pulse, with a\nduration of the order of a plasma wave period, excites an unusually strong\nplasma wake wave (laser wakefield). Recent experiments on laser wakefield\nacceleration [Nature (London) 431, p.535, p.538, p.541 (2004)] demonstrated\ngeneration of ultra-short (with a duration of a few femtoseconds) relativistic\nelectron bunches with relatively low energy spread of the order of a few\npercent. We have studied the dynamics of such bunches in vacuum and in laser\nwakefield. The results show strong bunch dynamics already on a few millimeters\npropagation distance in both cases. In vacuum, the bunch radius and emittance\nquickly grow. The latter worsens the focusability of the bunch. We found that\nwhen a femtosecond bunch is accelerated in a channel-guided laser wakefield,\nfor realistic bunch lengths, the bunch length is approximately conserved.\nHowever, the spread in betatron frequencies leads to fast betatron phase mixing\nin the bunch envelope for on-axis injection. When bunch is injected in a laser\nwakefield off-axis, the bunch decoherence results in considerable increase in\nthe normalized bunch emittance, and, in some cases, in increase in the energy\nspread, after acceleration. We also discuss a possible two-stage laser\nwakefield accelerator.\n",
