These analyses confirm the existence\nof a real-estate bubble, defined as a price acceleration faster than\nexponential, which is found however to be confined to a rather limited time\ninterval in the recent past from approximately 2003 to mid-2004 and has\nprogressively transformed into a more normal growth rate comparable to\npre-bubble levels in 2005. There has been no bubble till 2002 except for a\nmedium-sized surge in 1990. In addition, we have identified a strong yearly\nperiodicity which provides a good potential for fine-tuned prediction from\nmonth to month. A monthly monitoring using a model that we have developed could\nconfirm, by testing the intra-year structure, if indeed the market has returned\nto ``normal'' or if more turbulence is expected ahead. We predict the evolution\nof the indexes one year ahead, which is validated with new data up to Sep.\n2006. The present analysis demonstrates the existence of very significant\nvariations at the local scale, in the sense that the bubble in Las Vegas seems\nto have preceded the more global USA bubble and has ended approximately two\nyears earlier (mid 2004 for Las Vegas compared with mid-2006 for the whole of\nthe USA).\n",

We find that this emerging\nmarket exhibits strong correlations in the movement of stock prices compared to\ndeveloped markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). This is shown to\nbe due to the dominant influence of a common market mode on the stock prices.\nBy comparison, interactions between related stocks, e.g., those belonging to\nthe same business sector, are much weaker. This lack of distinct sector\nidentity in emerging markets is explicitly shown by reconstructing the network\nof mutually interacting stocks. Spectral analysis of C for NSE reveals that,\nthe few largest eigenvalues deviate from the bulk of the spectrum predicted by\nrandom matrix theory, but they are far fewer in number compared to, e.g., NYSE.\nWe show this to be due to the relative weakness of intra-sector interactions\nbetween stocks, compared to the market mode, by modeling stock price dynamics\nwith a two-factor model. Our results suggest that the emergence of an internal\nstructure comprising multiple groups of strongly coupled components is a\nsignature of market development.\n",

The former description implies that changing trading\nfrequency should alter the characteristic time of the phenomenon. This is not\ntrue for the empirical data: The Epps curves do not scale with market activity.\nThe latter result indicates that the time scale of the phenomenon is connected\nto the reaction time of market participants (this we denote as human time\nscale), independent of market activity. In this paper we give a new description\nof the Epps effect through the decomposition of cross-correlations. After\ntesting our method on a model of generated random walk price changes we justify\nour analytical results by fitting the Epps curves of real world data.\n",

        "abstract": "  A new framework for asset price dynamics is introduced in which the concept\nof noisy information about future cash flows is used to derive the price\nprocesses. In this framework an asset is defined by its cash-flow structure.\nEach cash flow is modelled by a random variable that can be expressed as a\nfunction of a collection of independent random variables called market factors.\nWith each such \"X-factor\" we associate a market information process, the values\nof which are accessible to market agents. Each information process is a sum of\ntwo terms; one contains true information about the value of the market factor;\nthe other represents \"noise\". The noise term is modelled by an independent\nBrownian bridge. The market filtration is assumed to be that generated by the\naggregate of the independent information processes. The price of an asset is\ngiven by the expectation of the discounted cash flows in the risk-neutral\nmeasure, conditional on the information provided by the market filtration. When\nthe cash flows are the dividend payments associated with equities, an explicit\nmodel is obtained for the share-price, and the prices of options on\ndividend-paying assets are derived. Remarkably, the resulting formula for the\nprice of a European call option is of the Black-Scholes-Merton type. The\ninformation-based framework also generates a natural explanation for the origin\nof stochastic volatility.\n",

        "abstract": "  The dynamics of many socioeconomic systems is determined by the decision\nmaking process of agents. The decision process depends on agent's\ncharacteristics, such as preferences, risk aversion, behavioral biases, etc..\nIn addition, in some systems the size of agents can be highly heterogeneous\nleading to very different impacts of agents on the system dynamics. The large\nsize of some agents poses challenging problems to agents who want to control\ntheir impact, either by forcing the system in a given direction or by hiding\ntheir intentionality. Here we consider the financial market as a model system,\nand we study empirically how agents strategically adjust the properties of\nlarge orders in order to meet their preference and minimize their impact. We\nquantify this strategic behavior by detecting scaling relations of allometric\nnature between the variables characterizing the trading activity of different\ninstitutions. We observe power law distributions in the investment time\nhorizon, in the number of transactions needed to execute a large order and in\nthe traded value exchanged by large institutions and we show that heterogeneity\nof agents is a key ingredient for the emergence of some aggregate properties\ncharacterizing this complex system.\n",

        "abstract": "  The cross-correlations between price fluctuations of 201 frequently traded\nstocks in the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India are analyzed in this\npaper. We use daily closing prices for the period 1996-2006, which coincides\nwith the period of rapid transformation of the market following liberalization.\nThe eigenvalue distribution of the cross-correlation matrix, $\\mathbf{C}$, of\nNSE is found to be similar to that of developed markets, such as the New York\nStock Exchange (NYSE): the majority of eigenvalues fall within the bounds\nexpected for a random matrix constructed from mutually uncorrelated time\nseries. Of the few largest eigenvalues that deviate from the bulk, the largest\nis identified with market-wide movements. The intermediate eigenvalues that\noccur between the largest and the bulk have been associated in NYSE with\nspecific business sectors with strong intra-group interactions. However, in the\nIndian market, these deviating eigenvalues are comparatively very few and lie\nmuch closer to the bulk. We propose that this is because of the relative lack\nof distinct sector identity in the market, with the movement of stocks\ndominantly influenced by the overall market trend. This is shown by explicit\nconstruction of the interaction network in the market, first by generating the\nminimum spanning tree from the unfiltered correlation matrix, and later, using\nan improved method of generating the graph after filtering out the market mode\nand random effects from the data. Both methods show, compared to developed\nmarkets, the relative absence of clusters of co-moving stocks that belong to\nthe same business sector. This is consistent with the general belief that\nemerging markets tend to be more correlated than developed markets.\n",

In our approach\nquantum-like probabilistic behaviour is a consequence of contextualy of\nstatistical data in finances (and economics in general).

We\nfind that the degree of consistency between real and model stock networks\nincreases as additional common economic factors are incorporated into our\nmodel. Furthermore, we find that individual stocks with a large number of links\nto other stocks in a network are more highly correlated with common economic\nfactors than those with a small number of links.

In the\nderivation, a Non-Gibrat's law under the detailed balance is adopted together\nwith following two approximations. Firstly, the probability density function of\nprofits growth rate is described as a tent-shaped exponential function.\nSecondly, the value of the origin of the growth rate distribution divided into\nbins is constant. The derivation is confirmed in the database consistently.\n  This static procedure is applied to a quasi-static system. We dynamically\ndescribe a quasi-static log-normal distribution in the middle scale region. In\nthe derivation, a Non-Gibrat's law under the detailed quasi-balance is adopted\ntogether with two approximations confirmed in the static system. The resultant\ndistribution is power-law with varying Pareto index in the large scale region\nand the quasi-static log-normal distribution in the middle scale region. In the\ndistribution, not only the change of Pareto index but also the change of the\nvariance of the log-normal distribution depends on the parameter of the\ndetailed quasi-balance. As a result, Pareto index and the variance of the\nlog-normal distribution are related to each other.\n",

To\nbetter understand the working behind the complexity, we undertook an empirical\nstudy measuring the interactions between market participants. A Web server was\nsetup to administer the exchange of futures contracts whose liquidation prices\nwere coupled to event outcomes. After free registration, participants started\ntrading to compete for the money prizes upon maturity of the futures contracts\nat the end of the experiment. The evolving `cash' flow network was\nreconstructed from the transactions between players. We show that the network\ntopology is hierarchical, disassortative and scale-free with a power law\nexponent of 1.02+-0.09 in the degree distribution. The small-world property\nemerged early in the experiment while the number of participants was still\nsmall. We also show power law distributions of the net incomes and\ninter-transaction time intervals. Big winners and losers are associated with\nhigh degree, high betweenness centrality, low clustering coefficient and low\ndegree-correlation. We identify communities in the network as groups of the\nlike-minded. The distribution of the community sizes is shown to be power-law\ndistributed with an exponent of 1.19+-0.16.\n",

We extend the standard log-normal process to include another\nrandom component in the so-called stochastic volatility models. We study these\nmodels under an assumption, akin to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, in\nwhich the volatility has already relaxed to its equilibrium distribution and\nacts as a background to the evolution of the price process. In this\napproximation, we show that all models of stochastic volatility should exhibit\na scaling relation in the time lag of zero-drift modified log-returns. We\nverify that the Dow-Jones Industrial Average index indeed follows this scaling.\nWe then focus on two popular stochastic volatility models, the Heston and\nHull-White models. In particular, we show that in the Hull-White model the\nresulting probability distribution of log-returns in this approximation\ncorresponds to the Tsallis (t-Student) distribution. The Tsallis parameters are\ngiven in terms of the microscopic stochastic volatility model. Finally, we show\nthat the log-returns for 30 years Dow Jones index data is well fitted by a\nTsallis distribution, obtaining the relevant parameters.\n",

        "abstract": "  Avalanches, or Avalanche-like, events are often observed in the dynamical\nbehaviour of many complex systems which span from solar flaring to the Earth's\ncrust dynamics and from traffic flows to financial markets. Self-organized\ncriticality (SOC) is one of the most popular theories able to explain this\nintermittent charge/discharge behaviour. Despite a large amount of theoretical\nwork, empirical tests for SOC are still in their infancy. In the present paper\nwe address the common problem of revealing SOC from a simple time series\nwithout having much information about the underlying system. As a working\nexample we use a modified version of the multifractal random walk originally\nproposed as a model for the stock market dynamics. The study reveals, despite\nthe lack of the typical ingredients of SOC, an avalanche-like dynamics similar\nto that of many physical systems. While, on one hand, the results confirm the\nrelevance of cascade models in representing turbulent-like phenomena, on the\nother, they also raise the question about the current state of reliability of\nSOC inference from time series analysis.\n",

        "abstract": "  We show that the Kullback-Leibler distance is a good measure of the\nstatistical uncertainty of correlation matrices estimated by using a finite set\nof data. For correlation matrices of multivariate Gaussian variables we\nanalytically determine the expected values of the Kullback-Leibler distance of\na sample correlation matrix from a reference model and we show that the\nexpected values are known also when the specific model is unknown. We propose\nto make use of the Kullback-Leibler distance to estimate the information\nextracted from a correlation matrix by correlation filtering procedures. We\nalso show how to use this distance to measure the stability of filtering\nprocedures with respect to statistical uncertainty. We explain the\neffectiveness of our method by comparing four filtering procedures, two of them\nbeing based on spectral analysis and the other two on hierarchical clustering.\nWe compare these techniques as applied both to simulations of factor models and\nempirical data. We investigate the ability of these filtering procedures in\nrecovering the correlation matrix of models from simulations. We discuss such\nan ability in terms of both the heterogeneity of model parameters and the\nlength of data series. We also show that the two spectral techniques are\ntypically more informative about the sample correlation matrix than techniques\nbased on hierarchical clustering, whereas the latter are more stable with\nrespect to statistical uncertainty.\n",

For such series, the sample\nautocorrelations decay slowly and log-log periodogram plots indicate a\nstraight-line relationship. This necessitates a class of models for describing\nsuch behavior. A popular class of such models is the autoregressive\nfractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA) which is a linear process.\nHowever, there is also a need for nonlinear long memory models. For example,\nseries of returns on financial assets typically tend to show zero correlation,\nwhereas their squares or absolute values exhibit long memory. Furthermore, the\nsearch for a realistic mechanism for generating long memory has led to the\ndevelopment of other nonlinear long memory models. In this chapter, we will\npresent several nonlinear long memory models, and discuss the properties of the\nmodels, as well as associated parametric andsemiparametric estimators.\n",

        "abstract": "  Adaptive populations such as those in financial markets and distributed\ncontrol can be modeled by the Minority Game. We consider how their dynamics\ndepends on the agents' initial preferences of strategies, when the agents use\nlinear or quadratic payoff functions to evaluate their strategies. We find that\nthe fluctuations of the population making certain decisions (the volatility)\ndepends on the diversity of the distribution of the initial preferences of\nstrategies. When the diversity decreases, more agents tend to adapt their\nstrategies together. In systems with linear payoffs, this results in dynamical\ntransitions from vanishing volatility to a non-vanishing one. For low signal\ndimensions, the dynamical transitions for the different signals do not take\nplace at the same critical diversity. Rather, a cascade of dynamical\ntransitions takes place when the diversity is reduced. In contrast, no phase\ntransitions are found in systems with the quadratic payoffs. Instead, a basin\nboundary of attraction separates two groups of samples in the space of the\nagents' decisions. Initial states inside this boundary converge to small\nvolatility, while those outside diverge to a large one. Furthermore, when the\npreference distribution becomes more polarized, the dynamics becomes more\nerratic. All the above results are supported by good agreement between\nsimulations and theory.\n",

        "abstract": "  The distribution of the return intervals $\\tau$ between volatilities above a\nthreshold $q$ for financial records has been approximated by a scaling\nbehavior. To explore how accurate is the scaling and therefore understand the\nunderlined non-linear mechanism, we investigate intraday datasets of 500 stocks\nwhich consist of the Standard & Poor's 500 index. We show that the cumulative\ndistribution of return intervals has systematic deviations from scaling. We\nsupport this finding by studying the m-th moment $\\mu_m \\equiv\n<(\\tau/<\\tau>)^m>^{1/m}$, which show a certain trend with the mean interval\n$<\\tau>$. We generate surrogate records using the Schreiber method, and find\nthat their cumulative distributions almost collapse to a single curve and\nmoments are almost constant for most range of $<\\tau>$. Those substantial\ndifferences suggest that non-linear correlations in the original volatility\nsequence account for the deviations from a single scaling law. We also find\nthat the original and surrogate records exhibit slight tendencies for short and\nlong $<\\tau>$, due to the discreteness and finite size effects of the records\nrespectively. To avoid as possible those effects for testing the multiscaling\nbehavior, we investigate the moments in the range $10<<\\tau>\\leq100$, and find\nthe exponent $\\alpha$ from the power law fitting $\\mu_m\\sim<\\tau>^\\alpha$ has a\nnarrow distribution around $\\alpha\\neq0$ which depend on m for the 500 stocks.\nThe distribution of $\\alpha$ for the surrogate records are very narrow and\ncentered around $\\alpha=0$. This suggests that the return interval distribution\nexhibit multiscaling behavior due to the non-linear correlations in the\noriginal volatility.\n",

In\nrecent years, a variation of the model has become a basic tool in studying\nproblems that arise in revenue management and dynamic/flexible pricing; and it\nis in this context that our study is undertaken. Based on a dynamic programming\nformulation and associated properties of the value function, we study in this\npaper a class of control that we call switch-over policies -- start from\naccepting only orders of the highest price, and switch to including lower\nprices as time goes by, with the switch-over times optimally decided via convex\nprogramming. We establish the asymptotic optimality of the switch-over policy,\nand develop pricing models based on this policy to optimize the price\nreductions over the decision horizon.\n",

Although EL possesses\nthese properties when the model is correctly specified, this paper shows that,\nin the presence of model misspecification, EL may cease to be root n convergent\nwhen the functions defining the moment conditions are unbounded (even when\ntheir expectations are bounded). In contrast, the related exponential tilting\n(ET) estimator avoids this problem. This paper shows that the ET and EL\nestimators can be naturally combined to yield an estimator called exponentially\ntilted empirical likelihood (ETEL) exhibiting the same $O(n^{-1})$ bias and the\nsame $O(n^{-2})$ variance as EL, while maintaining root n convergence under\nmodel misspecification.\n",

        "abstract": "  We fit the volatility fluctuations of the S&P 500 index well by a Chi\ndistribution, and the distribution of log-returns by a corresponding\nsuperposition of Gaussian distributions. The Fourier transform of this is,\nremarkably, of the Tsallis type. An option pricing formula is derived from the\nsame superposition of Black-Scholes expressions. An explicit analytic formula\nis deduced from a perturbation expansion around a Black-Scholes formula with\nthe mean volatility. The expansion has two parts. The first takes into account\nthe non-Gaussian character of the stock-fluctuations and is organized by powers\nof the excess kurtosis, the second is contract based, and is organized by the\nmoments of moneyness of the option. With this expansion we show that for the\nDow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 option data, a Delta-hedging strategy is close to being\noptimal.\n",

        "abstract": "  This study investigates empirically whether the degree of stock market\nefficiency is related to the prediction power of future price change using the\nindices of twenty seven stock markets. Efficiency refers to weak-form efficient\nmarket hypothesis (EMH) in terms of the information of past price changes. The\nprediction power corresponds to the hit-rate, which is the rate of the\nconsistency between the direction of actual price change and that of predicted\none, calculated by the nearest neighbor prediction method (NN method) using the\nout-of-sample. In this manuscript, the Hurst exponent and the approximate\nentropy (ApEn) are used as the quantitative measurements of the degree of\nefficiency. The relationship between the Hurst exponent, reflecting the various\ntime correlation property, and the ApEn value, reflecting the randomness in the\ntime series, shows negative correlation. However, the average prediction power\non the direction of future price change has the strongly positive correlation\nwith the Hurst exponent, and the negative correlation with the ApEn. Therefore,\nthe market index with less market efficiency has higher prediction power for\nfuture price change than one with higher market efficiency when we analyze the\nmarket using the past price change pattern. Furthermore, we show that the Hurst\nexponent, a measurement of the long-term memory property, provides more\nsignificant information in terms of prediction of future price changes than the\nApEn and the NN method.\n",

        "abstract": "  World currency network constitutes one of the most complex structures that is\nassociated with the contemporary civilization. On a way towards quantifying its\ncharacteristics we study the cross correlations in changes of the daily foreign\nexchange rates within the basket of 60 currencies in the period December 1998\n-- May 2005. Such a dynamics turns out to predominantly involve one outstanding\neigenvalue of the correlation matrix. The magnitude of this eigenvalue depends\nhowever crucially on which currency is used as a base currency for the\nremaining ones. Most prominent it looks from the perspective of a peripheral\ncurrency. This largest eigenvalue is seen to systematically decrease and thus\nthe structure of correlations becomes more heterogeneous, when more significant\ncurrencies are used as reference. An extreme case in this later respect is the\nUSD in the period considered. Besides providing further insight into subtle\nnature of complexity, these observations point to a formal procedure that in\ngeneral can be used for practical purposes of measuring the relative currencies\nsignificance on various time horizons.\n",

This can be\nviewed as a very simple agent based model in which all components of the model\nare validated against real data. Our empirical studies of order flow uncover\nseveral interesting regularities in the way trading orders are placed and\ncancelled. The resulting simple model of order flow is used to simulate price\nformation under a continuous double auction, and the statistical properties of\nthe resulting simulated sequence of prices are compared to those of real data.\nThe model is constructed using one stock (AZN) and tested on 24 other stocks.\nFor low volatility, small tick size stocks (called Group I) the predictions are\nvery good, but for stocks outside Group I they are not good. For Group I, the\nmodel predicts the correct magnitude and functional form of the distribution of\nthe volatility and the bid-ask spread, without adjusting any parameters based\non prices. This suggests that at least for Group I stocks, the volatility and\nheavy tails of prices are related to market microstructure effects, and\nsupports the hypothesis that, at least on short time scales, the large\nfluctuations of absolute returns are well described by a power law with an\nexponent that varies from stock to stock.\n",

Special cases include\nadditive error, rounding and combinations thereof. Our main result is that,\nsubject to smoothness conditions, the two scales realized volatility is robust\nto the form of contamination $Q$. To push the limits of our result, we show\nwhat happens for some models that involve rounding (which is not, of course,\nsmooth) and see in this situation how the robustness deteriorates with\ndecreasing smoothness. Our conclusion is that under reasonable smoothness, one\ndoes not need to consider too closely how the microstructure is formed, while\nif severe non-smoothness is suspected, one needs to pay attention to the\nprecise structure and also the use to which the estimator of volatility will be\nput.\n",

At present,\nseveral stochastic volatility models are discussed in the literature, differing\nin the dynamics attached to the volatility. The aim of the present work is to\ncompare the most recent results about three popular models: the Vasicek, Heston\nand exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models. We analyzed for each of them the\ntheoretical results known in the literature (volatility and return\ndistribution, higher-order moments and different-time correlations) in order to\ntest their predictive effectiveness on the outcomes of original numerical\nsimulations, paying particular attention to their ability to reproduce\nempirical statistical properties of prices. The numerical results demonstrate\nthat these models can be implemented maintaining all their features, especially\nin view of financial applications like market risk management or option\npricing. In order to critically compare the models, we also perform an\nempirical analysis of financial time series from the Italian stock market,\nshowing the exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model's ability to capture the\nstylized facts of volatility and log-return probability distributions.\n",

First, the relative u-entropy of two probability measures in\narbitrary probability spaces is defined. Then, specialising to discrete\nprobability spaces, we also introduce the absolute u-entropy of a probability\nmeasure. Both notions are based on the idea, borrowed from mathematical\nfinance, of maximising the expected utility of the terminal wealth of an\ninvestor. Moreover, u-entropy is also relevant in thermodynamics, as it can\nreplace the standard Boltzmann-Shannon entropy in the Second Law. If the\nutility function is logarithmic or isoelastic (a power function), then the\nwell-known notions of the Boltzmann-Shannon and Renyi relative entropy are\nrecovered. We establish the principal properties of relative and discrete\nu-entropy and discuss the links with several related approaches in the\nliterature.\n",

We analyze the influence of deterministic trends on the GARCH(1,1)\nparameters using Monte Carlo simulations. The statistical ensembles contain\nnumerically generated time series composed by GARCH(1,1) noise superposed on\ndeterministic trends. The GARCH(1,1) parameters characteristic for financial\ntime series longer than one year are not affected by the detrending errors. We\nalso show that if the ARCH coefficient is greater than the GARCH coefficient,\nthen the estimated GARCH(1,1) parameters depend on the number of monotonic\nparts of the trend and on the ratio between the trend and the noise amplitudes.\n",

        "abstract": "  American options are studied in a general discrete market in the presence of\nproportional transaction costs, modelled as bid-ask spreads. Pricing algorithms\nand constructions of hedging strategies, stopping times and martingale\nrepresentations are presented for short (seller's) and long (buyer's) positions\nin an American option with an arbitrary payoff. This general approach extends\nthe special cases considered in the literature concerned primarily with\ncomputing the prices of American puts under transaction costs by relaxing any\nrestrictions on the form of the payoff, the magnitude of the transaction costs\nor the discrete market model itself. The largely unexplored case of pricing,\nhedging and stopping for the American option buyer under transaction costs is\nalso covered. The pricing algorithms are computationally efficient, growing\nonly polynomially with the number of time steps in a recombinant tree model.\nThe stopping times realising the ask (seller's) and bid (buyer's) option prices\ncan differ from one another. The former is generally a so-called mixed\n(randomised) stopping time, whereas the latter is always a pure (ordinary)\nstopping time.\n",

We also find memory\neffects such that a large (or small) return interval follows a large (or small)\ninterval by investigating the conditional distribution and mean return\ninterval. The results are similar to previous studies of other markets and\nindicate that similar statistical features appear in different financial\nmarkets.

We adopt two types of\nactive traders in our MS model: speculators and arbitrageurs, and call and put\noptions on one underlying asset. Speculators make decisions based on their\nexpectations of the asset price at the option expiration time. Arbitrageurs\ntrade at different arbitrage opportunities such as violation of put-call\nparity. Difference in liquidity among options is also included. Notwithstanding\nits simplicity, our model can generate implied volatility (IV) curves similar\nto empirical observations. Our results suggest that the volatility smile is\nrelated to the competing effect of heterogeneous trading behavior and the\nimpact of differential liquidity.\n",

Traditionally, these phenomena have been studied\nbased on conditionally heteroscedastic models like ARCH, GARCH, IGARCH and\nFIGARCH, inter alia. One advantage of these models is their ability to capture\nnonlinear dynamics. Another interesting manner to study the volatility\nphenomena is by using measures based on the concept of entropy. In this paper\nwe investigate the long memory and volatility clustering for the SP 500, NASDAQ\n100 and Stoxx 50 indexes in order to compare the US and European Markets.\nAdditionally, we compare the results from conditionally heteroscedastic models\nwith those from the entropy measures. In the latter, we examine Shannon\nentropy, Renyi entropy and Tsallis entropy. The results corroborate the\nprevious evidence of nonlinear dynamics in the time series considered.\n",

The representative index for\ntopological properties of a stock network is the number of links with other\nstocks. We used the multi-factor model, extensively acknowledged in financial\nliterature. In the multi-factor model, common factors act as independent\nvariables while returns of individual stocks act as dependent variables. We\ncalculated the coefficient of determination, which represents the measurement\nvalue of the degree in which dependent variables are explained by independent\nvariables. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between the number of\nlinks in the stock network and the coefficient of determination in the\nmulti-factor model. We used individual stocks traded on the market indices of\nKorea, Japan, Canada, Italy and the UK. The results are as follows. We found\nthat the mean coefficient of determination of stocks with a large number of\nlinks have higher values than those with a small number of links with other\nstocks.

When multiple\nco-evolving data streams are observed, an important task is to determine how\nthese streams depend on each other, accounting for dynamic dependence patterns\nwithout imposing any restrictive probabilistic law governing this dependence.\nIn this paper we argue that flexible least squares (FLS), a penalized version\nof ordinary least squares that accommodates for time-varying regression\ncoefficients, can be deployed successfully in this context. Our motivating\napplication is statistical arbitrage, an investment strategy that exploits\npatterns detected in financial data streams. We demonstrate that FLS is\nalgebraically equivalent to the well-known Kalman filter equations, and take\nadvantage of this equivalence to gain a better understanding of FLS and suggest\na more efficient algorithm. Promising experimental results obtained from a\nFLS-based algorithmic trading system for the S&P 500 Futures Index are\nreported.\n",

The resistance and defect-fraction are\ncalculated as a function of time by Monte Carlo simulations using a resistor\nnetwork approach. It will be shown that when the auto-correlation function of\nthe fluctuations displays a non-exponential and non-power-law decay, the\ndistribution of the return intervals of extreme values is a stretched\nexponential, with exponent largely independent of the threshold. Recently, a\nstretched exponential distribution of the return intervals of extreme values\nhas been identified in long-term correlated time series by Bunde et al. (2003)\nand Altmann and Kantz (2005). Thus, the present results show that the stretched\nexponential distribution of the return intervals is not an exclusive feature of\nlong-term correlated time series.\n",

Moreover, the barriers may be monitored\neither continuously or discretely. In addition to the high-order accuracy of\nthe scheme, and the stretching effect of the coordinate transformation, the\nmain feature of this approach lies on a probability-based optimal determination\nof boundary conditions. This leads to much faster and accurate results when\ncompared with similar pricing approaches. The strength of the present scheme is\nparticularly demonstrated in the valuation of discretely monitored barrier\noptions where it yields values closest to those obtained from the only\nsemi-analytical valuation method available.\n",

The\nnonstationarity arises from systematic uneveness in noise traders' behavior.\nSpurious results arise mathematically from using a log increment with a\n'sliding window'. We explain why a hard to beat market demands martingale\ndynamics , and martingales with nonlinear variance generate nonstationary\nincrements. The nonstationarity is exhibited directly for Euro/Dollar FX data.\nWe observe that the Hurst exponent H_s generated by the using the sliding\nwindow technique on a time series plays the same role as does Mandelbrot's\nJoseph exponent. Finally, Mandelbrot originally assumed that the 'badly\nbehaved' second moment of cotton returns is due to fat tails, but that\nnonconvergent behavior is instead direct evidence for nonstationary increments.\nSummarizing, the evidence for scaling and fat tails as the basis for\neconophysics and financial economics is provided neither by FX markets nor by\ncotton price data.\n",

The problem of modelling and\npricing such an asset and associated derivatives is important, for example, in\nthe determination of optimal insurance claims reserve policies, and in the\npricing of reinsurance contracts. In the insurance setting, the aggregate\nclaims play the role of the cumulative gains, and the terminal cash flow\nrepresents the totality of the claims payable for the given accounting period.\nA similar example arises when we consider the accumulation of losses in a\ncredit portfolio, and value a contract that pays an amount equal to the\ntotality of the losses over a given time interval. An explicit expression for\nthe value process is obtained. The price of an Arrow-Debreu security on the\ncumulative gains process is determined, and is used to obtain a closed-form\nexpression for the price of a European-style option on the value of the asset.\nThe results obtained make use of various remarkable properties of the gamma\nbridge process, and are applicable to a wide variety of financial products\nbased on cumulative gains processes such as aggregate claims, credit portfolio\nlosses, defined-benefit pension schemes, emissions, and rainfall.\n",

We\ncomplement this result in several ways. First, we show that the geometric\ncondition is not necessary and a weaker, necessary and sufficient, condition is\npresented. While this condition is generally not directly verifiable, we show\nthat it simplifies to matrix non-degeneracy in a single point when the pricing\nfunctions are real analytic functions. In particular, any stochastic volatility\nmodel is then completed with an arbitrary European type option.

        "abstract": "  The t copula is often used in risk management as it allows for modelling tail\ndependence between risks and it is simple to simulate and calibrate. However,\nthe use of a standard t copula is often criticized due to its restriction of\nhaving a single parameter for the degrees of freedom (dof) that may limit its\ncapability to model the tail dependence structure in a multivariate case. To\novercome this problem, grouped t copula was proposed recently, where risks are\ngrouped a priori in such a way that each group has a standard t copula with its\nspecific dof parameter. In this paper we propose the use of a grouped t copula,\nwhere each group consists of one risk factor only, so that a priori grouping is\nnot required. The copula characteristics in the bivariate case are studied. We\nexplain simulation and calibration procedures, including a simulation study on\nfinite sample properties of the maximum likelihood estimators and Kendall's tau\napproximation. This new copula can be significantly different from the standard\nt copula in terms of risk measures such as tail dependence, value at risk and\nexpected shortfall.\n  Keywords: grouped t copula, tail dependence, risk management.\n",

A motivation for studying the nonlinear Black--Scholes equation with a\nnonlinear volatility arises from option pricing models taking into account e.g.\nnontrivial transaction costs, investor's preferences, feedback and illiquid\nmarkets effects and risk from a volatile (unprotected) portfolio. We present a\nnew method how to transform the free boundary problem for the early exercise\nboundary position into a solution of a time depending nonlinear parabolic\nequation defined on a fixed domain. We furthermore propose an iterative\nnumerical scheme that can be used to find an approximation of the free\nboundary. We present results of numerical approximation of the early exercise\nboundary for various types of nonlinear Black--Scholes equations and we discuss\ndependence of the free boundary on various model parameters.\n",

In this Letter, the appearance of\nforbidden patterns is studied in different economical indicators like stock\nindices (Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite), NYSE stocks (IBM\nand Boeing) and others (10-year Bond interest rate), to find evidences of\ndeterministic behavior in their evolutions.\n",

Several old and new strict local\nmartingales are identified. We treat examples of diffusions with various\nboundary behavior, size-bias sampling of diffusion paths, and non-colliding\ndiffusions. A multidimensional generalization to conformal strict local\nmartingales is achieved through Kelvin transform. As curious examples of\nnon-standard behavior, we show by various examples that strict local\nmartingales do not behave uniformly when the function (x-K)^+ is applied to\nthem. Implications to the recent literature on financial bubbles are discussed.\n",

        "abstract": "  We address the problem of likelihood based inference for correlated diffusion\nprocesses using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Such a task\npresents two interesting problems. First, the construction of the MCMC scheme\nshould ensure that the correlation coefficients are updated subject to the\npositive definite constraints of the diffusion matrix. Second, a diffusion may\nonly be observed at a finite set of points and the marginal likelihood for the\nparameters based on these observations is generally not available. We overcome\nthe first issue by using the Cholesky factorisation on the diffusion matrix. To\ndeal with the likelihood unavailability, we generalise the data augmentation\nframework of Roberts and Stramer (2001 Biometrika 88(3):603-621) to\nd-dimensional correlated diffusions including multivariate stochastic\nvolatility models. Our methodology is illustrated through simulation based\nexperiments and with daily EUR /USD, GBP/USD rates together with their implied\nvolatilities.\n",

Specifically, we find that for one hour intervals this model\nconsistently over-predicts the volatility of real price series by about 70%,\nand that this effect becomes stronger as the length of the intervals increases.\nBy selectively shuffling some components of the data while preserving others we\nare able to show that this discrepancy is caused by a subtle but long-range\nnon-contemporaneous correlation between the signs and sizes of individual\nreturns. We conjecture that this is related to the long-memory of transaction\nsigns and the need to enforce market efficiency.\n",

The arbitrage free\nconditions give a system of stochastic PDEs for the evolution of the implied\nvolatility surface ${\\hat\\sigma}_t(T,K)$. We will focus on the family obtained\nfixing a strike $K$ and varying $T$. In order to give conditions to prove an\nexistence-and-uniqueness result for the solution of the system it is here\nexpressed in terms of the square root of the forward implied volatility and\nrewritten in an Hilbert space setting. The existence and the uniqueness for the\n(arbitrage free) evolution of the forward implied volatility, and then of the\nthe implied volatility, among a class of models, are proved. Specific examples\nare also given.\n",

The Hurst\nexponent was used as the measurement of the degree of efficiency, and the hit\nrate calculated from the nearest-neighbor prediction method was used for the\nprediction of the directions of future price changes. We used 60 market indexes\nof various countries. We empirically discovered that the relationship between\nthe degree of efficiency (the Hurst exponent) and the predictability (the hit\nrate) is strongly positive. That is, a market index with a higher Hurst\nexponent tends to have a higher hit rate. These results suggested that the\nHurst exponent is useful for predicting future price changes. Furthermore, we\nalso discovered that the Hurst exponent and the hit rate are useful as\nstandards that can distinguish emerging capital markets from mature capital\nmarkets.\n",

Its main feature is the possibility to link both energies in\nthe long term and in the short term. For each energy, the future returns are\nrepresented as the sum of volatility functions driven by motions. Under the\nrisk neutral probability, the motions of both energies are correlated Brownian\nmotions while under the historical probability, they are cointegrated by a\nVectorial Error Correction Model. Our approach is equivalent to defining the\nmarket price of risk. This model is free of arbitrage: thus, it can be used for\nrisk management as well for option pricing issues. Calibration on European\nmarket data and numerical simulations illustrate well its behavior.\n",

We calculate exponential utility-based\nindifference prices, and corresponding derivative hedges. We use the fact that\nthey can be represented in terms of solutions of forward-backward stochastic\ndifferential equations (FBSDE) with quadratic growth generators. We derive the\nMarkov property of such FBSDE and generalize results on the differentiability\nrelative to the initial value of their forward components. In this case the\noptimal hedge can be represented by the price gradient multiplied with the\ncorrelation coefficient. This way we obtain a generalization of the classical\n'delta hedge' in complete markets.\n",

It is observed that the\nbifurcation phenomenon in financial index is not universal, but specific under\ncertain conditions. The phenomenon just emerges when the power-law exponent of\nabsolute increment distribution is between 1 and 2 with appropriate period.\nSimulations on a randomly generated time series suggest the bifurcation\nphenomenon itself is subject to the statistics of absolute increment, thus it\nmay not be able to reflect the essential financial behaviors.

To observe the effect of the Asian\ncurrency crisis, we also estimate the multifractal spectra of limited series\nbefore and after the crisis. We find that the Korean and Thai foreign exchange\nmarkets experienced a significant increase in multifractality compared to\nHong-Kong and Japan. We also show that the multifractality is stronge related\nto the presence of high values of returns in the series.\n",

We then discuss several popular parametric\nand nonparametric estimation methods. To avoid model mis-specification, model\nvalidation plays a key role in financial modeling. We discuss several model\nvalidation techniques, including pseudo-likelihood ratio test, nonparametric\ncurve regression based test, residuals based test, generalized likelihood ratio\ntest, simultaneous confidence band construction, and density based test.\nFinally, we briefly touch on tools for studying large sample properties.\n",

To address this\nissue we analyze a real dataset, namely, price fluctuations, in a wide range of\ntemporal scales to embrace both regimes. By means of Kramers-Moyal (KM)\ncoefficients evaluated from empirical time series, we obtain the evolution\nequation for the probability density function (PDF) of price returns. We also\npresent consistent asymptotic solutions for the timescale dependent equation\nthat emerges from the empirical analysis. From these solutions, new\nrelationships connecting PDF characteristics, such as tail exponents, to\nparameters of KM coefficients arise. The results reveal a dynamical path that\nleads from Gaussian to fat-tailed statistics, furnishing insights on other\ncomplex systems where akin crossover is observed.\n",

To this end, we\nconsider an econometric approach to investigate the outcomes of the\nlog-periodic model of price movements, which has been largely used to forecast\nfinancial crashes. In order to accomplish reliable statistical inference for\nunknown parameters, we incorporate an autoregressive dynamic and a conditional\nheteroskedasticity structure in the error term of the original model, yielding\nthe log-periodic-AR(1)-GARCH(1,1) model. Both the original and the extended\nmodels are fitted to financial indices of U. S. market, namely S&P500 and\nNASDAQ. Our analysis reveal two main points: (i) the\nlog-periodic-AR(1)-GARCH(1,1) model has residuals with better statistical\nproperties and (ii) the estimation of the parameter concerning the time of the\nfinancial crash has been improved.\n",

The foundation of this work is the\nmatrix-variate dynamic linear model, for the volatility of which we adopt a\nmultiplicative stochastic evolution, using Wishart and singular multivariate\nbeta distributions. A diagonal matrix of discount factors is employed in order\nto discount the variances element by element and therefore allowing a flexible\nand pragmatic variance modelling approach. Diagnostic tests and sequential\nmodel monitoring are discussed in some detail. The proposed estimation theory\nis applied to a four-dimensional time series, comprising spot prices of\naluminium, copper, lead and zinc of the London metal exchange. The empirical\nfindings suggest that the proposed Bayesian procedure can be effectively\napplied to financial data, overcoming many of the disadvantages of existing\nvolatility models.\n",

        "abstract": "  The purpose of this paper is to propose a time-varying vector autoregressive\nmodel (TV-VAR) for forecasting multivariate time series. The model is casted\ninto a state-space form that allows flexible description and analysis. The\nvolatility covariance matrix of the time series is modelled via inverted\nWishart and singular multivariate beta distributions allowing a fully conjugate\nBayesian inference. Model performance and model comparison is done via the\nlikelihood function, sequential Bayes factors, the mean of squared standardized\nforecast errors, the mean of absolute forecast errors (known also as mean\nabsolute deviation), and the mean forecast error. Bayes factors are also used\nin order to choose the autoregressive order of the model. Multi-step\nforecasting is discussed in detail and a flexible formula is proposed to\napproximate the forecast function. Two examples, consisting of bivariate data\nof IBM shares and of foreign exchange (FX) rates for 8 currencies, illustrate\nthe methods. For the IBM data we discuss model performance and multi-step\nforecasting in some detail. For the FX data we discuss sequential portfolio\nallocation; for both data sets our empirical findings suggest that the TV-VAR\nmodels outperform the widely used VAR models.\n",

By using support arguments we prove that\nthe resulting model is arbitrage free under proportional transaction costs in\nthe same spirit of Guasoni [Math. Finance 16 (2006) 569-582]. In particular, we\nobtain a drift condition which is similar in nature to the classical HJM\nno-arbitrage drift restriction. The second part of this paper deals with\nconsistency problems related to the fractional HJM dynamics. We give a fairly\ncomplete characterization of finite-dimensional invariant manifolds for HJM\nmodels with fractional Brownian motion by means of Nagumo-type conditions. As\nan application, we investigate consistency of Nelson-Siegel family with respect\nto Ho-Lee and Hull-White models. It turns out that similar to the Brownian case\nsuch a family does not go well with the fractional HJM dynamics with\ndeterministic volatility. In fact, there is no nontrivial fractional interest\nrate model consistent with the Nelson-Siegel family.\n",

A transformation of the dynamics of the\nconditional moment generating function allows us to solve the filtering\nproblem, between the jumps of the Cox process, as well as at the jumps.\nAssuming that the initial distribution of the intensity is of the Gamma type,\nwe obtain an explicit solution to the filtering problem for all t>0.

        "abstract": "  We develop a theory for valuing non-diversifiable mortality risk in an\nincomplete market. We do this by assuming that the company issuing a\nmortality-contingent claim requires compensation for this risk in the form of a\npre-specified instantaneous Sharpe ratio. We apply our method to value life\nannuities. One result of our paper is that the value of the life annuity is\n{\\it identical} to the upper good deal bound of Cochrane and Sa\\'{a}-Requejo\n(2000) and of Bj\\\"{o}rk and Slinko (2006) applied to our setting. A second\nresult of our paper is that the value per contract solves a {\\it linear}\npartial differential equation as the number of contracts approaches infinity.\nOne can represent the limiting value as an expectation with respect to an\nequivalent martingale measure (as in Blanchet-Scalliet, El Karoui, and\nMartellini (2005)), and from this representation, one can interpret the\ninstantaneous Sharpe ratio as an annuity market's price of mortality risk.\n",

        "abstract": "  A model proposed by Sornette, Takayasu, and Zhou for describing\nhyperinflation regimes based on adaptive expectations expressed in terms of a\npower law which leads to a finite-time singularity is revisited. It is\nsuggested to express the price index evolution explicitly in terms of the\nparameters introduced along the theoretical formulation avoiding any\ncombination of them used in the original work. This procedure allows to study\nunambiguously the uncertainties of such parameters when an error is assigned to\nthe measurement of the price index. In this way, it is possible to determine an\nuncertainty in the critical time at which the singularity occurs. For this\npurpose, Monte Carlo simulation techniques are applied. The hyperinflation\nepisodes of Peru (1969-90) and Weimar Germany (1920-3) are reexamined. The\nfirst analyses performed within this framework of the very extreme\nhyper-inflations occurred in Greece (1941-4) and Yugoslavia (1991-4) are\nreported. The study of the hyperinflation spiral experienced just nowadays in\nZimbabwe predicts a singularity, i.e., a complete economic crash within two\nyears.\n",

        "abstract": "  The continuous-time random walk (CTRW) is a pure-jump stochastic process with\nseveral applications in physics, but also in insurance, finance and economics.\nA definition is given for a class of stochastic integrals driven by a CTRW,\nthat includes the Ito and Stratonovich cases. An uncoupled CTRW with zero-mean\njumps is a martingale. It is proved that, as a consequence of the martingale\ntransform theorem, if the CTRW is a martingale, the Ito integral is a\nmartingale too. It is shown how the definition of the stochastic integrals can\nbe used to easily compute them by Monte Carlo simulation. The relations between\na CTRW, its quadratic variation, its Stratonovich integral and its Ito integral\nare highlighted by numerical calculations when the jumps in space of the CTRW\nhave a symmetric Levy alpha-stable distribution and its waiting times have a\none-parameter Mittag-Leffler distribution. Remarkably these distributions have\nfat tails and an unbounded quadratic variation. In the diffusive limit of\nvanishing scale parameters, the probability density of this kind of CTRW\nsatisfies the space-time fractional diffusion equation (FDE) or more in general\nthe fractional Fokker-Planck equation, that generalize the standard diffusion\nequation solved by the probability density of the Wiener process, and thus\nprovides a phenomenologic model of anomalous diffusion. We also provide an\nanalytic expression for the quadratic variation of the stochastic process\ndescribed by the FDE, and check it by Monte Carlo.\n",

The\nnumeraire portfolio generates a wealth process, with respect to which the\nrelative wealth processes of all other portfolios are supermartingales.\nNecessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the numeraire\nportfolio are obtained in terms of the triplet of predictable characteristics\nof the asset price process. This characterization is then used to obtain\nfurther necessary and sufficient conditions, in terms of a no-free-lunch-type\nnotion. In particular, the full strength of the \"No Free Lunch with Vanishing\nRisk\" (NFLVR) is not needed, only the weaker \"No Unbounded Profit with Bounded\nRisk\" (NUPBR) condition that involves the boundedness in probability of the\nterminal values of wealth processes. We show that this notion is the minimal\na-priori assumption required in order to proceed with utility optimization. The\nfact that it is expressed entirely in terms of predictable characteristics\nmakes it easy to check, something that the stronger NFLVR condition lacks.\n",

        "abstract": "  These lectures notes aim at introducing L\\'{e}vy processes in an informal and\nintuitive way, accessible to non-specialists in the field. In the first part,\nwe focus on the theory of L\\'{e}vy processes. We analyze a `toy' example of a\nL\\'{e}vy process, viz. a L\\'{e}vy jump-diffusion, which yet offers significant\ninsight into the distributional and path structure of a L\\'{e}vy process. Then,\nwe present several important results about L\\'{e}vy processes, such as infinite\ndivisibility and the L\\'{e}vy-Khintchine formula, the L\\'{e}vy-It\\^{o}\ndecomposition, the It\\^{o} formula for L\\'{e}vy processes and Girsanov's\ntransformation. Some (sketches of) proofs are presented, still the majority of\nproofs is omitted and the reader is referred to textbooks instead. In the\nsecond part, we turn our attention to the applications of L\\'{e}vy processes in\nfinancial modeling and option pricing. We discuss how the price process of an\nasset can be modeled using L\\'{e}vy processes and give a brief account of\nmarket incompleteness. Popular models in the literature are presented and\nrevisited from the point of view of L\\'{e}vy processes, and we also discuss\nthree methods for pricing financial derivatives. Finally, some indicative\nevidence from applications to market data is presented.\n",

The Feller conditions are\nusually imposed on a continuous time multivariate square root process to ensure\nthat the roots have nonnegative arguments. For a discrete time approximate\nmodel, the Feller conditions do not give this guarantee. Moreover, in a\nmacro-finance context the restrictions imposed might be economically\nunappealing. At the same time, it has also been observed that even without the\nFeller conditions imposed, for a practically relevant term structure model,\nnegative arguments rarely occur. Using models estimated on German data, we\ncompare the yields implied by (approximate) analytic exponentially affine\nexpressions to those obtained through Monte Carlo simulations of very high\nnumbers of sample paths. It turns out that the differences are rarely\nstatistically significant, whether the Feller conditions are imposed or not.\nMoreover, economically the differences are negligible, as they are always below\none basis point.\n",

In this model the prices are driven by a Geometric\nBrownian motion, whose diffusion coefficient is expressed through an\nexponential function of an hidden variable Y governed by a mean-reverting\nprocess. We derive closed-form expressions for the probability distribution and\nits characteristic function in two limit cases. In the first one the\nfluctuations of Y are larger than the volatility normal level, while the second\none corresponds to the assumption of a small stationary value for the variance\nof Y. Theoretical results are tested numerically by intensive use of Monte\nCarlo simulations. The effectiveness of the analytical predictions is checked\nvia a careful analysis of the parameters involved in the numerical\nimplementation of the Euler-Maruyama scheme and is tested on a data set of\nfinancial indexes. In particular, we discuss results for the German DAX30 and\nDow Jones Euro Stoxx 50, finding a good agreement between the empirical data\nand the theoretical description.\n",

        "abstract": "  We analyze the problem of the analytical characterization of the probability\ndistribution of financial returns in the exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model\nwith stochastic volatility. In this model the prices are driven by a Geometric\nBrownian motion, whose diffusion coefficient is expressed through an\nexponential function of an hidden variable Y governed by a mean-reverting\nprocess. We derive closed-form expressions for the probability distribution and\nits characteristic function in two limit cases. In the first one the\nfluctuations of Y are larger than the volatility normal level, while the second\none corresponds to the assumption of a small stationary value for the variance\nof Y. Theoretical results are tested numerically by intensive use of Monte\nCarlo simulations. The effectiveness of the analytical predictions is checked\nvia a careful analysis of the parameters involved in the numerical\nimplementation of the Euler-Maruyama scheme and is tested on a data set of\nfinancial indexes. In particular, we discuss results for the German DAX30 and\nDow Jones Euro Stoxx 50, finding a good agreement between the empirical data\nand the theoretical description.\n",

        "abstract": "  The purpose of this survey chapter is to present a transformation technique\nthat can be used in analysis and numerical computation of the early exercise\nboundary for an American style of vanilla options that can be modelled by class\nof generalized Black-Scholes equations. We analyze qualitatively and\nquantitatively the early exercise boundary for a linear as well as a class of\nnonlinear Black-Scholes equations with a volatility coefficient which can be a\nnonlinear function of the second derivative of the option price itself. A\nmotivation for studying the nonlinear Black-Scholes equation with a nonlinear\nvolatility arises from option pricing models taking into account e.g.\nnontrivial transaction costs, investor's preferences, feedback and illiquid\nmarkets effects and risk from a volatile (unprotected) portfolio. We present a\nmethod how to transform the free boundary problem for the early exercise\nboundary position into a solution of a time depending nonlinear nonlocal\nparabolic equation defined on a fixed domain. We furthermore propose an\niterative numerical scheme that can be used in order to find an approximation\nof the free boundary. In the case of a linear Black-Scholes equation we are\nable to derive a nonlinear integral equation for the position of the free\nboundary. We present results of numerical approximation of the early exercise\nboundary for various types of linear and nonlinear Black-Scholes equations and\nwe discuss dependence of the free boundary on model parameters. Finally, we\ndiscuss an application of the transformation method for the pricing equation\nfor American type of Asian options.\n",

        "abstract": "  We present a new method for articulating scale-dependent topological\ndescriptions of the network structure inherent in many complex systems. The\ntechnique is based on \"Partition Decoupled Null Models,'' a new class of null\nmodels that incorporate the interaction of clustered partitions into a random\nmodel and generalize the Gaussian ensemble. As an application we analyze a\ncorrelation matrix derived from four years of close prices of equities in the\nNYSE and NASDAQ. In this example we expose (1) a natural structure composed of\ntwo interacting partitions of the market that both agrees with and generalizes\nstandard notions of scale (eg., sector and industry) and (2) structure in the\nfirst partition that is a topological manifestation of a well-known pattern of\ncapital flow called \"sector rotation.'' Our approach gives rise to a natural\nform of multiresolution analysis of the underlying time series that naturally\ndecomposes the basic data in terms of the effects of the different scales at\nwhich it clusters. The equities market is a prototypical complex system and we\nexpect that our approach will be of use in understanding a broad class of\ncomplex systems in which correlation structures are resident.\n",

        "abstract": "  In this paper we show how to relate European call and put options on multiple\nassets to certain convex bodies called lift zonoids. Based on this, geometric\nproperties can be translated into economic statements and vice versa. For\ninstance, the European call-put parity corresponds to the central symmetry\nproperty, while the concept of dual markets can be explained by reflection with\nrespect to a plane. It is known that the classical univariate log-normal model\nbelongs to a large class of distributions with an extra property, analytically\nknown as put-call symmetry. The geometric interpretation of this symmetry\nproperty motivates a natural multivariate extension. The financial meaning of\nthis extension is explained, the asset price distributions that have this\nproperty are characterised and their further properties explored. It is also\nshown how to relate some multivariate asymmetric distributions to symmetric\nones by a power transformation that is useful to adjust for carrying costs. A\nparticular attention is devoted to the case of asset prices driven by L\\'evy\nprocesses. Based on this, semi-static hedging techniques for multiasset barrier\noptions are suggested.\n",

        "abstract": "  A new framework for asset pricing based on modelling the information\navailable to market participants is presented. Each asset is characterised by\nthe cash flows it generates. Each cash flow is expressed as a function of one\nor more independent random variables called market factors or \"X-factors\". Each\nX-factor is associated with a \"market information process\", the values of which\nbecome available to market participants. In addition to true information about\nthe X-factor, the information process contains an independent \"noise\" term\nmodelled here by a Brownian bridge. The information process thus gives partial\ninformation about the X-factor, and the value of the market factor is only\nrevealed at the termination of the process. The market filtration is assumed to\nbe generated by the information processes associated with the X-factors. The\nprice of an asset is given by the risk-neutral expectation of the sum of the\ndiscounted cash flows, conditional on the information available from the\nfiltration. The theory is developed in some detail, with a variety of\napplications to credit risk management, share prices, interest rates, and\ninflation. A number of new exactly solvable models are obtained for the price\nprocesses of various types of assets and derivative securities; and a novel\nmechanism is proposed to account for the dynamics of stochastic volatility and\ndynamic correlation. A discrete-time version of the information-based framework\nis also developed, and is used to construct a new class of models for the real\nand nominal interest rate term structures, and the dynamics of the associated\nprice index.\n",

        "abstract": "  This paper demonstrates the usefulness and importance of the concept of\nhonest times to financial modeling. It studies a financial market with asset\nprices that follow jump-diffusions with negative jumps. The central building\nblock of the market model is its growth optimal portfolio (GOP), which\nmaximizes the growth rate of strictly positive portfolios. Primary security\naccount prices, when expressed in units of the GOP, turn out to be nonnegative\nlocal martingales. In the proposed framework an equivalent risk neutral\nprobability measure need not exist. Derivative prices are obtained as\nconditional expectations of corresponding future payoffs, with the GOP as\nnumeraire and the real world probability as pricing measure. The time when the\nglobal maximum of a portfolio with no positive jumps, when expressed in units\nof the GOP, is reached, is shown to be a generic representation of an honest\ntime. We provide a general formula for the law of such honest times and compute\nthe conditional distributions of the global maximum of a portfolio in this\nframework. Moreover, we provide a stochastic integral representation for\nuniformly integrable martingales whose terminal values are functions of the\nglobal maximum of a portfolio. These formulae are model independent and\nuniversal. We also specialize our results to some examples where we hedge a\npayoff that arrives at an honest time.\n",

We make only weak\nassumptions about the underlying process (typically continuity), but assume\nthat the initial prices of call options with the same maturity and all strikes\nare known. Under such circumstances, we are able to give upper and lower bounds\non the arbitrage-free prices of the relevant options, and further, using\ntechniques from the theory of Skorokhod embeddings, to show that these bounds\nare tight. Additionally, martingale inequalities are derived, which provide the\ntrading strategies with which we are able to realise any potential arbitrages.\nWe show that, depending of the risk aversion of the investor, the resulting\nhedging strategies can outperform significantly the standard delta/vega-hedging\nin presence of market frictions and/or model misspecification.\n",

Using our results on the behaviour of call\noptions close to expiry we show that implied volatility explodes as\n$\\tau\\to0^+$ in \"most\" exponential L\\'evy models.

This naturally explains the anomalous\ndependence of the skew as a function of maturity of the option. The market cap\ndependence of the leverage effect is analyzed using a one-factor model. We show\nhow this leverage correlation gives rise to a non-trivial smile dynamics, which\nturns out to be intermediate between the \"sticky strike\" and the \"sticky delta\"\nrules. Finally, we compare our result with stock option data, and find that\noption markets overestimate the leverage effect by a large factor, in\nparticular for long dated options.\n",

        "abstract": "  In this paper we are interested in term structure models for pricing zero\ncoupon bonds under rapidly oscillating stochastic volatility. We analyze\nsolutions to the generalized Cox-Ingersoll-Ross two factors model describing\nclustering of interest rate volatilities. The main goal is to derive an\nasymptotic expansion of the bond price with respect to a singular parameter\nrepresenting the fast scale for the stochastic volatility process. We derive\nthe second order asymptotic expansion of a solution to the two factors\ngeneralized CIR model and we show that the first two terms in the expansion are\nindependent of the variable representing stochastic volatility.\n",

        "abstract": "  Perpetual American options are financial instruments that can be readily\nexercised and do not mature. In this paper we study in detail the problem of\npricing this kind of derivatives, for the most popular flavour, within a\nframework in which some of the properties |volatility and dividend policy| of\nthe underlying stock can change at a random instant of time, but in such a way\nthat we can forecast their final values. Under this assumption we can model\nactual market conditions because most relevant facts usually entail sharp\npredictable consequences. The effect of this potential risk on perpetual\nAmerican vanilla options is remarkable: the very equation that will determine\nthe fair price depends on the solution to be found. Sound results are found\nunder the optics both of finance and physics. In particular, a parallelism\namong the overall outcome of this problem and a phase transition is\nestablished.\n",

        "abstract": "  The paper proposes a class of financial market models which are based on\ninhomogeneous telegraph processes and jump diffusions with alternating\nvolatilities. It is assumed that the jumps occur when the tendencies and\nvolatilities are switching. We argue that such a model captures well the stock\nprice dynamics under periodic financial cycles. The distribution of this\nprocess is described in detail. For this model we obtain the structure of the\nset of martingale measures. This incomplete model can be completed by adding\nanother asset based on the same sources of randomness. Explicit closed-form\nformulae for prices of the standard European options are obtained for the\ncompleted market model.\n",

        "abstract": "  First passage models, where corporate assets undergo correlated random walks\nand a company defaults if its assets fall below a threshold provide an\nattractive framework for modeling the default process. Typical one year default\ncorrelations are small, i.e., of order a few percent, but nonetheless including\ncorrelations is very important, for managing portfolio credit risk and pricing\nsome credit derivatives (e.g. first to default baskets). In first passage\nmodels the exact dependence of the joint survival probability of more than two\nfirms on their asset correlations is not known. We derive an expression for the\ndependence of the joint survival probability of $n$ firms on their asset\ncorrelations using first order perturbation theory in the correlations. It\nincludes all terms that are linear in the correlations but neglects effects of\nquadratic and higher order. For constant time independent correlations we\ncompare the first passage model expression for the joint survival probability\nwith what a multivariate normal Copula function gives. As a practical\napplication of our results we calculate the dependence of the five year joint\nsurvival probability for five basic industrials on their asset correlations.\n",

We obtain a\nsimple characterization of self-financing trading strategies and a sufficient\ncondition for no arbitrage. We consider a stochastic volatility model in which\nthe volatility is partly correlated with the liquidity process and show that,\nwith the use of variance swaps, contingent claims whose payoffs depend on the\nvalue of the asset can be approximately replicated in this setting. The\nreplicating costs of such payoffs are obtained from the solutions of BSDEs with\nquadratic growth and analytical properties of these solutions are investigated.\n",

To provide\na numerical illustration, this transform approach is compared with Monte Carlo\nsimulation in the cases that the driving process is a VG and a NIG Levy\nprocess. Parameters are calibrated to Stoxx50E call options.\n",

        "abstract": "  Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) are two risk\nmeasures which are widely used in the practice of risk management. This paper\ndeals with the problem of computing both VaR and CVaR using stochastic\napproximation (with decreasing steps): we propose a first Robbins-Monro\nprocedure based on Rockaffelar-Uryasev's identity for the CVaR. The convergence\nrate of this algorithm to its target satisfies a Gaussian Central Limit\nTheorem. As a second step, in order to speed up the initial procedure, we\npropose a recursive importance sampling (I.S.) procedure which induces a\nsignificant variance reduction of both VaR and CVaR procedures. This idea,\nwhich goes back to the seminal paper of B. Arouna, follows a new approach\nintroduced by V. Lemaire and G. Pag\\`es. Finally, we consider a deterministic\nmoving risk level to speed up the initialization phase of the algorithm. We\nprove that the convergence rate of the resulting procedure is ruled by a\nCentral Limit Theorem with minimal variance and its efficiency is illustrated\nby considering several typical energy portfolios.\n",

We illustrate the symmetry in the valuation and show that the\nadjustment involves a long position in a put option plus a short position in a\ncall option, both with zero strike and written on the residual net value of the\ncontract at the relevant default times. We allow for correlation between the\ndefault times of the investor, counterparty and underlying portfolio risk\nfactors. We use arbitrage-free stochastic dynamical models. We then specialize\nour analysis to Credit Default Swaps (CDS) as underlying portfolio,\ngeneralizing the work of Brigo and Chourdakis (2008) [5] who deal with\nunilateral and asymmetric counterparty risk. We introduce stochastic intensity\nmodels and a trivariate copula function on the default times exponential\nvariables to model default dependence. Similarly to [5], we find that both\ndefault correlation and credit spread volatilities have a relevant and\nstructured impact on the adjustment. Differently from [5], the two parties will\nnow agree on the credit valuation adjustment. We study a case involving British\nAirways, Lehman Brothers and Royal Dutch Shell, illustrating the bilateral\nadjustments in concrete crisis situations.\n",

        "abstract": "  Three situations in which filtering theory is used in mathematical finance\nare illustrated at different levels of detail. The three problems originate\nfrom the following different works: 1) On estimating the stochastic volatility\nmodel from observed bilateral exchange rate news, by R. Mahieu, and P.\nSchotman; 2) A state space approach to estimate multi-factors CIR models of the\nterm structure of interest rates, by A.L.J. Geyer, and S. Pichler; 3)\nRisk-minimizing hedging strategies under partial observation in pricing\nfinancial derivatives, by P. Fischer, E. Platen, and W. J. Runggaldier; In the\nfirst problem we propose to use a recent nonlinear filtering technique based on\ngeometry to estimate the volatility time series from observed bilateral\nexchange rates. The model used here is the stochastic volatility model. The\nfilters that we propose are known as projection filters, and a brief derivation\nof such filters is given. The second problem is introduced in detail, and a\npossible use of different filtering techniques is hinted at. In fact the\nfilters used for this problem in 2) and part of the literature can be\ninterpreted as projection filters and we will make some remarks on how more\ngeneral and possibly more suitable projection filters can be constructed. The\nthird problem is only presented shortly.\n",

        "abstract": "  In this work we derive an approximated no-arbitrage market valuation formula\nfor Constant Maturity Credit Default Swaps (CMCDS). We move from the CDS\noptions market model in Brigo (2004), and derive a formula for CMCDS that is\nthe analogous of the formula for constant maturity swaps in the default free\nswap market under the LIBOR market model. A \"convexity adjustment\"-like\ncorrection is present in the related formula. Without such correction, or with\nzero correlations, the formula returns an obvious deterministic-credit-spread\nexpression for the CMCDS price. To obtain the result we derive a joint dynamics\nof forward CDS rates under a single pricing measure, as in Brigo (2004).\nNumerical examples of the \"convexity adjustment\" impact complete the paper.\n",

As numerical illustration we apply the method to the\nvaluation of several barrier-type options (double barrier knockout option,\nAmerican corridor and double no touch) under a number of different models,\nincluding a case with deterministic interest rates, and compare with Monte\nCarlo simulation results. In all cases we find tight bounds with short\nexecution times. Theoretical convergence results are also provided.\n",

In option\nmarkets, the most popular way has been to extract implied volatilities to\nassess the future variability of the underlying with the use of the Black and\nScholes formula. In this manuscript, we propose a novel way to extract the\nwhole time varying distribution of the market implied asset price from option\nprices.

We establish existence and uniqueness of\nequilibrium results and show that the equilibrium dynamics can be characterized\nin terms of a coupled system of possibly non-linear PDEs.

        "abstract": "  This article presents differential equations and solution methods for the\nfunctions of the form $Q(x) = F^{-1}(G(x))$, where $F$ and $G$ are cumulative\ndistribution functions. Such functions allow the direct recycling of Monte\nCarlo samples from one distribution into samples from another. The method may\nbe developed analytically for certain special cases, and illuminate the idea\nthat it is a more precise form of the traditional Cornish-Fisher expansion. In\nthis manner the model risk of distributional risk may be assessed free of the\nMonte Carlo noise associated with resampling. Examples are given of equations\nfor converting normal samples to Student t, and converting exponential to\nhyperbolic, variance gamma and normal. In the case of the normal distribution,\nthe change of variables employed allows the sampling to take place to good\naccuracy based on a single rational approximation over a very wide range of the\nsample space. The avoidance of any branching statement is of use in optimal GPU\ncomputations as it avoids the effect of {\\it warp divergence}, and we give\nexamples of branch-free normal quantiles that offer performance improvements in\na GPU environment, while retaining the best precision characteristics of\nwell-known methods. We also offer models based on a low-probability of warp\ndivergence. Comparisons of new and old forms are made on the Nvidia Quadro\n4000, GTX 285 and 480, and Tesla C2050 GPUs. We argue that in single-precision\nmode, the change-of-variables approach offers performance competitive with the\nfastest existing scheme while substantially improving precision, and that in\ndouble-precision mode, this approach offers the most GPU-optimal Gaussian\nquantile yet, and without compromise on precision for Monte Carlo applications,\nworking twice as fast as the CUDA 4 library function with increased precision.\n",

Key steps are the construction of super- and\nsub-hedging strategies to establish the bounds, and the use of Skorokhod\nembedding techniques to show the bounds are the best possible.\n  In addition to establishing rigorous bounds, we consider carefully what is\nmeant by arbitrage in settings where there is no {\\it a priori} known\nprobability measure. We discuss two natural extensions of the notion of\narbitrage, weak arbitrage and weak free lunch with vanishing risk, which are\nneeded to establish equivalence between the lack of arbitrage and the existence\nof a market model.\n",

        "abstract": "  Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance (CPPI) is a strategy designed to give\nparticipation in a risky asset while protecting the invested capital. Some gap\nrisk due to extreme events is often kept by the issuer of the product: a put\noption on the CPPI strategy is included in the product. In this paper we\npresent a new method for the pricing of CPPIs and options on CPPIs, which is\nmuch faster and more accurate than the usual Monte-Carlo method. Provided the\nunderlying follows a homogeneous process, the path-dependent CPPI strategy is\nreformulated into a Markov process in one variable, which allows to use\nefficient linear algebra techniques. Tail events, which are crucial in the\npricing are handled smoothly. We incorporate in this framework linear\nthresholds, profit lock-in, performance coupons... The American exercise of\nopen-ended CPPIs is handled naturally through backward propagation. Finally we\nuse our pricing scheme to study the influence of various features on the gap\nrisk of CPPI strategies.\n",

As a key step in obtaining the representation result we prove a\nclosure property for integrals with respect to Poisson random measures, a\nresult of interest on its own that extends the analog property for integrals\nwith respect to a fixed semimartingale due to M\\'emin (1980).

        "abstract": "  We provide a new dynamic approach to scenario generation for the purposes of\nrisk management in the banking industry. We connect ideas from conventional\ntechniques -- like historical and Monte Carlo simulation -- and we come up with\na hybrid method that shares the advantages of standard procedures but\neliminates several of their drawbacks. Instead of considering the static\nproblem of constructing one or ten day ahead distributions for vectors of risk\nfactors, we embed the problem into a dynamic framework, where any time horizon\ncan be consistently simulated. Additionally, we use standard models from\nmathematical finance for each risk factor, whence bridging the worlds of\ntrading and risk management.\n  Our approach is based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs), like the\nHJM-equation or the Black-Scholes equation, governing the time evolution of\nrisk factors, on an empirical calibration method to the market for the chosen\nSDEs, and on an Euler scheme (or high-order schemes) for the numerical\nevaluation of the respective SDEs. The empirical calibration procedure\npresented in this paper can be seen as the SDE-counterpart of the so called\nFiltered Historical Simulation method; the behavior of volatility stems in our\ncase out of the assumptions on the underlying SDEs. Furthermore, we are able to\neasily incorporate \"middle-size\" and \"large-size\" events within our framework\nalways making a precise distinction between the information obtained from the\nmarket and the one coming from the necessary a-priori intuition of the risk\nmanager.\n  Results of one concrete implementation are provided.\n",

A key innovation of the\nnumerical scheme is an effective tail integration approximation that reduces\nthe truncation errors significantly with little extra effort. High precision\nresults of the 0.999 quantile and CVaR were obtained for compound losses with\nheavy tails and a very wide range of loss frequencies using the DNI, Fast\nFourier Transform (FFT) and Monte Carlo (MC) methods. These results,\nparticularly relevant to operational risk modelling, can serve as benchmarks\nfor comparing different numerical methods. We found that the adaptive DNI can\nachieve high accuracy with relatively coarse grids. It is much faster than MC\nand competitive with FFT in computing high quantiles and CVaR of compound\ndistributions in the case of moderate to high frequencies and heavy tails.\n",

        "abstract": "  An efficient conditioning technique, the so-called Brownian Bridge\nsimulation, has previously been applied to eliminate pricing bias that arises\nin applications of the standard discrete-time Monte Carlo method to evaluate\noptions written on the continuous-time extrema of an underlying asset. It is\nbased on the simple and easy to implement analytic formulas for the\ndistribution of one-dimensional Brownian Bridge extremes. This paper extends\nthe technique to the valuation of multi-asset options with knock-out barriers\nimposed for all or some of the underlying assets. We derive formula for the\nunbiased option price estimator based on the joint distribution of the\nmulti-dimensional Brownian Bridge dependent extrema. As analytic formulas are\nnot available for the joint distribution in general, we develop upper and lower\nbiased option price estimators based on the distribution of independent extrema\nand the Fr\\'echet lower and upper bounds for the unknown distribution. All\nestimators are simple and easy to implement. They can always be used to bind\nthe true value by a confidence interval. Numerical tests indicate that our\nbiased estimators converge rapidly to the true option value as the number of\ntime steps for the asset path simulation increases in comparison to the\nestimator based on the standard discrete-time method. The convergence rate\ndepends on the correlation and barrier structures of the underlying assets.\n",

This\npaper studies the impact of ignoring data truncation on the 0.999 quantile of\nthe annual loss distribution for operational risk for a broad range of\ndistribution parameters and truncation levels. Loss frequency and severity are\nmodelled by the Poisson and Lognormal distributions respectively. Two cases of\nignoring data truncation are studied: the \"naive model\" - fitting a Lognormal\ndistribution with support on a positive semi-infinite interval, and \"shifted\nmodel\" - fitting a Lognormal distribution shifted to the truncation level. For\nall practical cases, the \"naive model\" leads to underestimation (that can be\nsevere) of the 0.999 quantile. The \"shifted model\" overestimates the 0.999\nquantile except some cases of small underestimation for large truncation\nlevels. Conservative estimation of capital charge is usually acceptable and the\nuse of the \"shifted model\" can be justified while the \"naive model\" should not\nbe allowed. However, if parameter uncertainty is taken into account (in\npractice it is often ignored), the \"shifted model\" can lead to considerable\nunderestimation of capital charge. This is demonstrated with a practical\nexample.\n",

The distribution of the relative price, defined as the\nrelative difference between the order price in opening call auction and the\nclosing price of last trading day, is asymmetric and that the distribution\ndisplays a sharp peak at zero relative price and a relatively wide peak at\nnegative relative price. The detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) method is\nadopted to investigate the long-term memory of relative order prices. We\nfurther study the statistical regularities of order sizes in opening call\nauction, and observe a phenomenon of number preference, known as order size\nclustering. The probability density function (PDF) of order sizes could be well\nfitted by a $q$-Gamma function, and the long-term memory also exists in order\nsizes. In addition, both the average volume and the average number of orders\ndecrease exponentially with the price level away from the best bid or ask price\nlevel in the limit-order book (LOB) established immediately after the opening\ncall auction, and a price clustering phenomenon is observed.\n",

        "abstract": "  In the first quarter of 2006 Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE)\nintroduced, as one of the listed products, options on its implied volatility\nindex (VIX). This created the challenge of developing a pricing framework that\ncan simultaneously handle European options, forward-starts, options on the\nrealized variance and options on the VIX. In this paper we propose a new\napproach to this problem using spectral methods. We use a regime switching\nmodel with jumps and local volatility defined in \\cite{FXrev} and calibrate it\nto the European options on the S&P 500 for a broad range of strikes and\nmaturities. The main idea of this paper is to \"lift\" (i.e. extend) the\ngenerator of the underlying process to keep track of the relevant path\ninformation, namely the realized variance. The lifted generator is too large a\nmatrix to be diagonalized numerically. We overcome this difficulty by applying\na new semi-analytic algorithm for block-diagonalization. This method enables us\nto evaluate numerically the joint distribution between the underlying stock\nprice and the realized variance, which in turn gives us a way of pricing\nconsistently European options, general accrued variance payoffs and\nforward-starting and VIX options.\n",

In this paper we assume that\nthe asset price process $S$ is Markov with cadlag paths and propose a scheme\nfor computing the law of the realized variance of the log returns accrued while\nthe asset was trading in a prespecified corridor. We thus obtain an algorithm\nfor pricing and hedging volatility derivatives and derivatives on the\ncorridor-realized variance in such a market. The class of models under\nconsideration is large, as it encompasses jump-diffusion and Levy processes. We\nprove the weak convergence of the scheme and describe in detail the\nimplementation of the algorithm in the characteristic cases where $S$ is a CEV\nprocess (continuous trajectories), a variance gamma process (jumps with\nindependent increments) or an infinite activity jump-diffusion (discontinuous\ntrajectories with dependent increments).\n",

This formulation enables several\nkey properties of the indifference price $\\pi(B)$ of a claim $B$ satisfying\nconditions weaker than those assumed in literature.

We develop an effective description of state of the game.\nFor the payoff function $g(x)=\\sgn (x)$ we explicitly represent the game as the\nMarkov process and prove the finitness of number of states. We also demonstrate\nboundedness of the utility function. Using these facts we can explain all\ninteresting observable features of the aggregated demand: appearance of strong\nfluctuations, their periodicity and existence of prefered levels. For another\npayoff, $g(x)=x$, the number of states is still finite and utility remains\nbounded but the number of states cannot be reduced and probabilities of states\nare not calculated. However, using properties of the utility and analysing the\ngame in terms of de Bruijn graphs, we can also explain distinct peaks of demand\nand their frequencies.\n",

        "abstract": "  In finance industry portfolio construction deals with how to divide the\ninvestors' wealth across an asset-classes' menu in order to maximize the\ninvestors' gain. Main approaches in use at the present are based on variations\nof the classical Markowitz model. However, recent evolutions of the world\nmarket showed limitations of this method and motivated many researchers and\npractitioners to study alternative methodologies to portfolio construction. In\nthis paper we propose one approach to optimal portfolio construction based on\nrecent results on stochastic reachability, which overcome some of the limits of\ncurrent approaches. Given a sequence of target sets that the investors would\nlike their portfolio to stay within, the optimal portfolio allocation is\nsynthesized in order to maximize the joint probability for the portfolio value\nto fulfill the target sets requirements. A case study in the US market is given\nwhich shows benefits from the proposed methodology in portfolio construction. A\ncomparison with traditional approaches is included.\n",

Using artificial QGARCH\ndata we infer the QGARCH parameters by applying the adaptive construction\nscheme to the Bayesian inference of QGARCH model.

        "abstract": "  In usual stochastic volatility models, the process driving the volatility of\nthe asset price evolves according to an autonomous one-dimensional stochastic\ndifferential equation. We assume that the coefficients of this equation are\nsmooth. Using It\\^o's formula, we get rid, in the asset price dynamics, of the\nstochastic integral with respect to the Brownian motion driving this SDE.\nTaking advantage of this structure, we propose - a scheme, based on the\nMilstein discretization of this SDE, with order one of weak trajectorial\nconvergence for the asset price, - a scheme, based on the Ninomiya-Victoir\ndiscretization of this SDE, with order two of weak convergence for the asset\nprice. We also propose a specific scheme with improved convergence properties\nwhen the volatility of the asset price is driven by an Orstein-Uhlenbeck\nprocess. We confirm the theoretical rates of convergence by numerical\nexperiments and show that our schemes are well adapted to the multilevel Monte\nCarlo method introduced by Giles [2008a, 2008b].\n",
